Abstract
In this work, we demonstrate that multilingual large-scale sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models,
pre-trained on a mixture of denoising and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) tasks, are more ecient
few-shot learners than decoder-only models on various tasks. In particular, we train a 20 billion parameter
multilingual seq2seq model called Alexa Teacher Model (AlexaTM 20B) and show that it achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 1-shot summarization tasks, outperforming a much larger 540B
PaLM decoder model. AlexaTM 20B also achieves SOTA in 1-shot machine translation, especially for
low-resource languages, across almost all language pairs supported by the model (Arabic, English, French,
German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Marathi, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil, and Telugu) on Flores-101
dataset. We also show in zero-shot setting, AlexaTM 20B outperforms GPT3 (175B) on SuperGLUE
and SQuADv2 datasets and provides SOTA performance on multilingual tasks such as XNLI, XCOPA,
Paws-X, and XWinograd. Overall, our results present a compelling case for seq2seq models as a powerful
alternative to decoder-only models for Large-scale Language Model (LLM) training.
1 Introduction
Recent studies (Brown et al., 2020b; Chowdhery et al., 2022) have demonstrated that Large-scale Language
Models (LLMs) are capable of learning from few examples without any gradient updates (a.k.a. in-context
learning). This capability of LLMs has been demonstrated to improve as the size of the model and the
pre-training data increases (Rae et al., 2021; Homann et al., 2022). However, most previous work has
focused on decoder-only models as the architecture of choice for LLMs. The main shortcoming of decoder-only
architecture is the unidirectional attention to the context (Radford & Narasimhan, 2018) which can be critical
for long-context tasks such as summarization. Conceptually, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture
provides a better t for training generative LLMs without losing the bidirectionally of the attention layers.
Inspired by these considerations, in this work, we demonstrate that transformer-based seq2seq models can
be used as few-shot learners, outperforming much larger decoder-only counterparts on the relevant core
tasks. We pre-train a multilingual 20 billion parameter seq2seq model, which we will refer to as Alexa
Teacher Model (AlexaTM 20B), on a mix of denoising and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) tasks in Arabic,
English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Marathi, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil, and Telugu, using
the Wikipedia and mC4 datasets (Xue et al., 2021). We follow Homann et al. (2022) and pre-train the
model for roughly 1 Trillion tokens (longer than the 300B token updates of GPT-3). AlexaTM 20B is the
rst multilingual seq2seq model of this size with previous models having up to 11 billion parameters (Xue
et al., 2021). AlexaTM 20B is also the rst multilingual seq2seq model capable of in-context learning, since

1arXiv:2208.01448v2  [cs.CL]  3 Aug 2022almost all previously pre-trained seq2seq models were trained exclusively on denoising tasks (Rael et al.,
2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2021), and thus are not suitable for in-context learning.
We demonstrate that not only AlexaTM 20B is capable of few-shot learning, but also outperforms much
larger decoder-only models (e.g., PaLM 540B) on tasks that require attention to a long context, such
as summarization. We show that AlexaTM 20B performs better than or on par with PaLM 540B on
XSUM (Narayan et al., 2018) and MLSum (de and es) (Scialom et al., 2020) both in one-shot in-context
learning and when ne-tuned. We also evaluate the AlexaTM 20B on the SuperGLUE and SQuADv2 datasets
in zero-shot setting and show that it outperforms GPT3 175B on short context tasks, despite having 8x fewer
parameters.
AlexaTM 20B achieves SOTA in MT across almost all language pairs supported by the model on the Flores-101
dataset (Goyal et al., 2022), outperforming existing supervised models using only one-shot. The gain on
translation to/from low-resource languages like Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu is signicant (e.g., 21.8 Arabic to
Tamil spBleu score compared to 0.9 score of the supervised M2M-124 615M model (Goyal et al., 2022)). The
results suggest that large-scale seq2seq-style pre-training, as formulated in this work, may be the best way to
improve low-resource language MT with limited training pairs, especially when a large amount of monolingual
data is available. AlexaTM 20B also performs very well translating directly from dierent languages, in
contrast to many-to-many MT systems that are trained mainly on to/from English language pairs (Fan et al.,
2021). We believe these results suggest a paradigm shift in how MT systems should be developed.
Additionally, we evaluate AlexaTM 20B on multilingual tasks including XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018),
XCOPA (Ponti et al., 2020), Paws-X (Yang et al., 2019), and XWinograd (Tikhonov & Ryabinin, 2021). We
show that AlexaTM 20B provides SOTA performance in zero-shot setting for all of these tasks, across all
supported languages, improving on previous SOTA achieved by the XGLM 7.5B model (Lin et al., 2021).
In order to understand the risks associated with using this model, we also analyze the amount of memorization
in AlexaTM 20B and assess its fairness and biases. In contrast to Carlini et al. (2022)'s observations for
GPT3, AlexaTM 20B's memorization slightly decreases with increasing context size in both the CLM and
denoising modes. This suggests that the denoising objective (perhaps, coupled with multilinguality of the
model) may be breaking the memorization of longer contexts by the model. While the ability to memorize
training data can in principle degrade model performance on some tasks, it also alleviates some of the privacy
concerns associated with training LLMs.
With respect to bias and toxicity, the model provides SOTA results on Winogender bias benchmark in
zero-shot setting. However, consistent with prior work, we observe that in open-ended generation, AlexaTM
20B Toxicity Probability of Continuation (TPC) increases with Toxicity Probability of Prompt (TPP) (i.e.,
toxic prompts lead the model to generate more toxic continuations). Although, TPC is lower than TPP for
the majority of the cases and that TPC is lower than the human baseline for low toxicity prompts.
Overall, we demonstrate that the proposed style of pre-training of seq2seq models shows better performance
compared to much larger decoder-only LLMs across dierent tasks, both in a few-shot setting and with
ne-tuning. Additionally, we did not observe any negative results relative to decoder-only LLMs of similar size.
We hope our work presents a compelling case for seq2seq models as a powerful alternative to decoder-only
models for LLM training.
To summarize, the main contributions of our work are four-fold: 1) we train and release the largest available
multilingual seq2seq model on a mix of denoising and CLM tasks and show that it is capable of few-shot
in-context learning, 2) we demonstrate that large-scale seq2seq models are better at in-context learning when
the context is long (e.g., summarization) compared to much larger decoder-only models, 3) we demonstrate
that an 8x smaller seq2seq model can peform on par or better than GPT3 175B on SuperGLUE and
SQuAD benchmarks, suggesting the eciency of seq2seq models training, and 4) we show the strength of
seq2seq multilingual pre-training in one-shot MT, suggesting a new paradigm for non-English-centric MT
and low-resource languages.
We will release the AlexaTM 20B model on https://github.com/amazon-research/alexa-teacher-models .
22 Model Architecture
For AlexaTM 20B, we used the standard Transformer model architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) with learnable
positional embeddings with the small modication of moving the layernorms (both in the encoder and the
decoder) to be located exactly at the beginning of each layer (right after the skip connection) instead of at
the end of each layer (i.e., Pre-LN). This modication has been demonstrated to improve the stability of the
training, especially for large models (Shoeybi et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2020). Table 1 shows the detailed
hyper-parameters of the AlexaTM 20B's architecture.

3 Training Data Preparation
3.1 Datasets
The pre-training data consists of Wikipedia and mC4 (Xue et al., 2021) datasets. We use the data in 12
languages, namely, Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Marathi, Portuguese, Spanish,
Tamil, and Telugu. We pack sequences of tokens to produce sequences of approximately 1024 subword units.
We allow unrelated content to be packed together in the same sequence but we separate them with a special
symbol ( [DOC] ). Maintaining a relatively constant number of subword sequences reduces padding and results
in ecient compute.

mC4= 0:5 lang sampling, then

Table 2: Source datasets and sampling methods for the training set.
Since our objective is to allow AlexaTM 20B to act on both spoken queries and written text, we use a written
to spoken formatter for all languages to format the data into spoken format (remove capitalization, remove
punctuations, etc.). We include more spoken than written text to satisfy our internal use cases. The nal
training set, described in Table 2, is developed by combining data from various sources using three types of
mixing:
•Frequency based upsampling which helps increase the representation of under-represented languages
following Conneau et al. (2020). In particular, we sample sentences according to a multinomial
distribution with probabilities ( q1;q2;:::;qN), where:
qi=p
iPN
j=1p
j; pi=niPN
j=1nj(1)

task 80% and on the Causal Language Modeling 20% of the time. pre-training data consists of Wikipedia
and mC4 datasets in 12 languages as specied in Section 3.
in whichNis the total number of languages and niis the total number of sentences in language i(we
set= 0:5).
•Upsampling Wikipedia data (which has a higher quality) by 10 to be represented more in all data.
•Scaling to favor spoken format over written 7 to 3.
We followed Brown et al. (2020b) and ltered out known benchmarks from the training data by checking for
13-gram overlaps between each sentence and the benchmarks (for the list of ltered datasets see Appendix C).
3.2 Subword Tokenizer
We use SentencePiece (SP) (Kudo & Richardson, 2018) to tokenize the input. We trained a unigram-based
model of SP to determine a set of sub-words that best represents the training data. Our nal choice was
to train a 150K unigram sentencepiece model from a 7 to 3 mixture ratio of spoken to written data. We
reserve 1K vocabulary entries to be used for tags in downstream tasks (e.g., parse nodes in semantic parsing
task). We also manually augment the vocabulary with a few entries to guarantee better character and word
coverage.
4 Training Setup
AlexaTM 20B model class is derived from BART (Lewis et al., 2020) class implementation in Huggingface (Wolf
et al., 2019) allowing us to benet from the generate function built in the parent class for inference. To
train the model, we used a denoising objective in which we drop 15% of the tokens in the input (in spans
of length determined by a Poisson distribution with mean equal to 3) and expect the model to reconstruct
the input. We do not add any mask tokens in the input during training: 1) to have the most consistency
during pre-training, inference, and ne-tuning (i.e., no mask tokens appear in any setting), 2) to require
the decoder to play a more active role during pre-training, and 3) to leverage the 10B encoder that we had
trained previously (FitzGerald et al., 2022) to initialize AlexaTM 20B's encoder (adding [MASK] would have
made decoder job easy given encoder's ability in \unmasking").
To make our model more ecient for in-context learning, we added an extra Causal Language Modeling
(CLM) task to the 20B training for 20% of the time.1In this task, the model is required to continue the
input instead of denoising the input. The model will know to do CLM based on a special token that we add
to the beginning of the sentence ( [CLM] ). For the CLM task, we only feed a single document (instead of
concatenation of multiple documents) and give 20% to 80% of the document randomly (uniformly) as the
input to the model (so the model learns to continue both from long inputs and short inputs).
1The CLM using seq2seq models has also been called Prex Language Modeling (PLM) (Rael et al., 2020). However, since
the term \prex" has been excessively used recently in other context (Li & Liang, 2021), we prefer to use CLM to avoid any
confusions.
4To speed up the model training, we initialized the encoder by an internal 10B pre-trained encoder FitzGerald
et al. (2022) (we also initialize the decoder embeddings and LM head embeddings with the embedding from
encoder but we do not tie any pair of embeddings). During training, we initially keep the encoder frozen (for
around 100k updates) but unfreeze the encoder to train the model end to end.
We trained AlexaTM 20B for 120 days on 128 A100 GPUs for the total of 500k updates with the accumulated
batch size of 2 million tokens (total of 1 trillion token updates). We used Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba,
2015) with lr= 1e 4with linear decay to lr= 5e 6over 500k updates. We used weight decay of 0 :1 on all
parameters except biases and layernorms. Finally, we trained the model in BFloat16 which helped with the
stability of training (Rael et al., 2020).
We used DeepSpeed's ZeRO Stage 3 (Rasley et al., 2020) to partition model weights, optimizer states, and
gradients across all GPU workers, allowing us to train the model with high throughput. We relied on an
internal and optimized version of DeepSpeed that we have since open-sourced (Chiu & Zheng, 2022) to obtain
training throughput of up to 154 TFLOPS/GPU on 16 AWS p4d.24xlarge compute instances.
5 Evaluation Setups
We evaluate AlexaTM 20B both using zero/few-shot in-context learning as well as by netuning the model
on selected generation tasks. In all few-shot learning settings, we use greedy search.
5.1 Few-shot Learning
Since AlexaTM 20B is trained both on denoising and CLM tasks, both of these modes can be used for
in-context learning. In this subsection, we describe some of the techniques that we used for in-context learning
using the model.
For some tasks, instead of asking the model to generate answers, we present multiple inputs to the model
(corresponding to task labels/choices) and calculate the model's score for each input. We refer to this as
scoring. Specically, we provide the encoder and decoder inputs to AlexaTM 20B (e.g. see Table A3) and
compute the cross-entropy loss in the decoder with teacher-forcing for each set of inputs. The model predicts
the task label or choice with the best score.
5.1.1 Denoising Mode
The denoising mode can be used both for generation (by dropping a few tokens from end of a prompt) and
scoring (by dropping tokens from the input and comparing the loss for dierent output choices). Notice that
since during pre-training we dropped only short spans, the generation in denoising mode is most eective
when only a few tokens are omitted in the input.
5.1.2 CLM Mode
The CLM mode is similar to the way previous large-scale decoder-only models have been using these models
for generation and scoring for in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020b; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Lin et al.,
2021). We follow these works and use the CLM mode of AlexaTM 20B for various tasks. The CLM mode
can also be used for scoring when the task provides choices to select from.
55.1.3 CLM Mode with Fusion in the Decoder
One benet of seq2seq models compared to decoder-only models is that we can t more shots into their
context using Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) idea which was initially proposed by Izacard & Grave (2021). For this
and in few-shot settings, we encode many 1-shot examples using the encoder and let the decoder attend to all
of these examples while generating the output. Throughout this paper, when we use FiD idea, we denote
number of shots bysuch as 32-shots.
5.2 Fine-tuning
We also netune AlexaTM 20B on a selected generation tasks to compare its performance to previous seq2seq
as well as much larger decoder-only models (when netuned). For all the netunings, we add [CLM] to the
beginning of the input (basically netuning the model in the CLM mode, although denoising mode could
also be used but may require extra number of training steps). For all the tasks that we netune AlexaTM
20B, we use adam with lr= 1e 6with linear decay to lr= 1e 7and picked the best checkpoint based on
validation perplexity. Given the netuning cost, we did not do any task specic hyper-parameter searches.
6 Evaluation Results
In this section, we evaluate the AlexaTM 20B performance across monolingual and multilingual tasks. In
particular, we demonstrate that AlexaTM 20B performs better or in par to the largest dense decoder-only
model to date (i.e., PaLM 540B) in summarization both in 1-shot and ne-tuning settings. We also show that
AlexaTM 20B provides the best scores in Flores 101 Machine Translation (MT) in almost all languages pairs
supported by the model (especially for low-resource languages like Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu). Moreover, it
performs on par or better than GPT3 175B parameter model across various English tasks in zero-shot (e.g.,
SuperGLUE). Nevertheless, we demonstrate that there are dierent tasks like \reasoning" that the model
cannot do as well as much larger models.
Additionally, we evaluate AlexaTM 20B on a few multilingual datasets including XNLI, XCOPA, Paws-X,
and XWinograd and show that AlexaTM 20B achieves SOTA numbers in zero-shot on all these tasks across
all languages better than XGLM 7.5B model (Lin et al., 2021). The prompts used for each task and the
evaluation mode are provided in Appendix B.

ROUGE-2 scores on dierent summarization tasks both in 1-shot as well as when netuned.2As can be seen,
AlexaTM 20B outperforms PaLM 540B model across all tasks when netuned, indicating that for tasks that
require attention to a long context, even a 25 times larger decoder-only model cannot compensate for a lack
of bidirection attention mechanism.
Moreover, although one would have expected that a netuned seq2seq model should perform better than a
netuned decoder-only (rather much larger) model, as can be seen in the Tables 3 and 4, even in the 1-shot
setting the AlexaTM 20B performs better than PaLM 540B (except only in ROUGE-2 on XSum). These
results reveal an inherent weakness of decoder-only models on tasks that have a long context.

As can be seen in Table 5, for these tasks, the decoder-only models perform much better than AlexaTM
20B (although we can bridge the gap by providing the model with more shots). Nevertheless, as in the
summarization case, in the netuned case, the AlexaTM 20B performs on par or better than PaLM 62B and
540B models.

Finally, we compared AlexaTM 20B to T5 XXL (LM-Adapt) (Lester et al., 2021) and a very recent UL2

720B (Tay et al., 2022) that are trained very similarly to our model. In particular, T5 XXL (LM-adapt) is T5
model (Rael et al., 2020) which has been train on CLM task for extra 100k updates (for 1.1 trillion token
updates in total including the T5 pre-training). The UL2 20B is also a seq2seq model which has been trained
(concurrently to our work) on a mix of CLM and denoising tasks on English only data for 1 trillion token
updates. We report UL2 20B numbers for XSum from the paper but computed the T5 XXL (LM-adapt)
ourselves. As can be seen in Table 6, the AlexaTM 20B outperforms both T5 XXL (LM-adapt) and UL2 20B
in 1-shot summarization. In contradiction to what reported by Tay et al. (2022), however, we observe that
T5 XXL (LM-adapt) performs very strongly across dierent tasks. Especially, it outperforms UL2 20B in
1-shot summarization on XSum and PaLM 62B on MLSUM (es and de). This may suggest why the prompt
tuning idea of Lester et al. (2021) worked on T5 XXL (LM-adapt), since the model is already a good few-shot
learner (and why it probably did not work as well on the original T5 model).
The T5 XXL (LM-adapt) also performs very well on E2E and WebNLG tasks. In particular it performs
better than AlexaTM 20B in 1-shot settings in E2E. However, in both tasks AlexaTM 20B performs better
in few-shot settings. Since UL2 20B did not report on these tasks, we only compared to T5 XXL (LM-adapt).
Overall, performance evaluation of our model and T5 XXL (LM-adapt) on generation tasks demonstrates
that seq2seq models are as good as or better than decoder-only models that are limited by their unidirectional
attention.
6.2 Machine Translation
In order to evaluate cross-lingual capabilities of AlexaTM 20B. We evaluated it on a few Machine Translation
(MT) datasets. First, since AlexaTM 20B is multilingual, we used Flores-101 (Goyal et al., 2022) dataset
to evaluate the model performance on all language pairs supported by the model on a high quality test set.
Moreover, since this dataset is for evaluating MT models only (i.e., provides no training data), it seems to be
the perfect test set to evaluate few-shot capabilities of large-scale language models.
Table 7 presents the spBLEU scores (as recommended to be used on this dataset) on all language pairs devtest
set. For each language pair, we used 1-shot from Flores-101 dev set (we experimented on using 4-shot but we
did not see any gains as shown in Table A1 in the appendix). As can be seen, AlexaTM 20B outperforms
the supervised M2M-124 615M model from Goyal et al. (2022) and XGLM 7.5B, which is a multilingual
decoder-only model (Lin et al., 2021), across almost all pairs. In particular, the gains on translation to/from
low-resource languages like Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu are signicant. This suggests that seq2seq style
pre-training on large-scale, as we proposed here, may be the best way to improve on low-resource languages
with limited training pairs (although this depends on having a good amount of monolingual data on the
target low-resource language).
Moreover, it is clear from the results that the model is perfectly capable of translating directly from dierent
languages in opposed to many to many MT systems that are trained mainly on to/from English language
pairs. The presented results could result in a paradigm shift on how MT systems are developed.
To compare AlexaTM 20B against much larger GPT 175B and PaLM 540B, we also evaluated the model on
English-German WMT'16, English-French WMT'14, and German-French WMT'19 test sets. Results are
presented in Tables 8 and 9. As can be seen, in most English centric cases AlexaTM 20B performs better
than GPT3 175B but it trails much larger PaLM 540B model. Nevertheless, on French to/from German
translation, AlexaTM 20B performs better than PaLM 540B in 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Moreover, it
provides a new SOTA on French to German WMT'19 translation task.

106.3 Multilingual NLP Tasks
We follow Lin et al. (2021) and evaluate AlexaTM 20B on four multilingual data sets to evaluate its
performance on non-English tasks. In particular, we test the model's 0-shot performance on XNLI (Conneau
et al., 2018), XCOPA (Ponti et al., 2020), Paws-X (Yang et al., 2019), and XWinograd (Tikhonov & Ryabinin,
2021). As can be seen in Table 10, AlexaTM 20B performs better or on par to XGLM 7.5B (Lin et al., 2021)
across all tasks and languages (supported by both models). See Table A3 for example prompts for each task.

language scores.
6.4 English NLP Tasks
To demonstrate AlexaTM 20B performance on English tasks and compare its performance to larger decoder
only models. We evaluated the model performance on SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019) and SQuADv2 (Ra-
jpurkar et al., 2018) in zero-shot setting.
For most of the tasks in SuperGLUE as well as for SQUADv2, we observed that adding a dummy example or
two to the prompt help the model generate outputs in the desired format. Hence, we adding questions like
\Is the context written in English?" or \What is the rst word in the context?" to the prompts for dierent
tasks. To see the exact prompt used for each task, please refer to Appendix B.
6.4.1 SuperGLUE
Zero-shot results on SuperGLUE dev set are presented in Table 11. As can be seen, although AlexaTM 20B
is behind PaLM 540B on SuperGLUE tasks on average, it performs better than GPT3 175B. Moreover, it
achieves a new SOTA on zero-shot CB task. It can also be seen that AlexaTM 20B outperforms recently
released BLOOM 175B decoder-only model.3
3While we were nalizing this paper, Huggingface released BLOOM 175B ( https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) .
However, it is yet to be fully evaluated across dierent tasks. Hence, we only include the available scores in our paper.

not reported by the authors.
6.4.2 SQuAD
As can be seen in Table 12, AlexaTM 20B performs better than GPT 175B but cannot reach to PaLM 540B
model performance. This is consistent with the results we observed on SuperGLUE indicating that to reach
the 540B parameter model performance, we need to scale up the seq2seq model size as well (although not as
extremely).

6.5 Shortcoming on Reasoning Tasks
In this section, we share AlexaTM 20B performance on MultiArith (Roy & Roth, 2016) dataset. We also
follow Kojima et al. (2022) and use prompts like "Let's think step by step" to elicit better reasoning by the
model. We refer to the results with such a prompt by Zero-shot-CoT following the Chain of Thought work by
Wei et al. (2022). For the exact prompts used for AlexaTM 20B, see Table A6 in the Appendix.
Table 13 presents the zero-shot results with and without the special prompt. T0 is a seq2seq model trained on
top of T5 in multitasks setting to understand prompts (Sanh et al., 2021) and OPT is an English decoder-only
model (Zhang et al., 2022). As can be seen, AlexaTM 20B performs slightly better than similar sized
models. However, we did not observe the gain that much larger models like GPT3 175B show from such
special prompts. The results indicate that scaling up the model parameteres is crucial in performing well in
\reasoning" tasks as was previously demonstrated by Kojima et al. (2022) in decoder-only architectures using
Instruct-GPT3 (Ouyang et al., 2022) models.

7 Memorization
In this section, we present an analysis of the training data memorization observed in AlexaTM 20B. To explore
memorization, we use the Wikipedia English training dataset which was used as part of the pretraining
corpus (see Section 3). We focus on two main properties that prior research has shown to contribute to
memorization in language models: (1) the frequency of occurrence in the training data (i.e., the repetitions
of a given sequence in the training data) and (2) the context size (i.e., how much context was used in the
extraction process).
Prior work also shows that frequency of occurrence in the training data follows an exponential distribution
(Lee et al., 2022), so that a sample drawn at random is unlikely to contain any signal from the tail of the
distribution (Carlini et al., 2022). To address this issue via the construction of a duplication-normalized subset
(i.e. a dataset that has an equal proportion of utterances of a range of frequency bins), Carlini et al. (2022)
used a sux array (expanding on the implementation by Lee et al. 2022). We follow a similar methodology
and use a sux array to create a subset of data that accounts for sequences that fall into a wide range of
frequencies, from our Wikipedia English training dataset.
While Carlini et al. (2022) sampled from a range of discrete sequence lengths, we use sequence length bins that
center on their values l2100;150;:::;500;550(i.e. bin edges that scale as 50 m+ 75 where m20;:::10).
For each sequence length bin and integer n, we select Xsequences that have a frequency of occurrence in
training data between 2n=4and 2(n+1)=4, similar to Carlini et al. (2022). Due to the relatively small size of
the Wikipedia English dataset, sequences with larger frequencies are rare. Hence we consider all frequency
bins withX > 50 and collect up to a maximum of X= 2000 per frequency bin. We bootstrap the available
data in each bin 100 times in order to obtain mean and standard deviation of our memorization measurement
and include that in our plots (Figure 2). For exploring memorization as a function of frequency of occurrence
in the training data, we consider only the rst sequence length bin (i.e. all sequences with <125 tokens). For
exploring memorization as a function of context size, we obtain sequences that occurred with frequency <3
in the training data, across all sequence length bins.
AlexaTM 20B has been pretrained using two objectives, CLM and denoising. For the CLM task, the model
predicts subsequent tokens to a given input whereas for the denoising task, 15% of the tokens are removed from
the input and the model is expected to denoise it (see Section 4). To explore memorization using the CLM
task, we remove the last 50 tokens (the sux) from each tokenized sequence from our duplication-normalized
subset and prompt the model with the remaining tokens (the prex). We run greedy decoding and measure
how often the model produces a 50-token output that exactly matches the sux (Figures 2a and 2b). For
studying the memorization using the denoising task, we remove a single token (i.e. span of length=1) from
the middle of the tokenized sequence from our duplication-normalized subset and prompt the model with
the remaining tokens (the corrupted input). We measure how often the model produces an output that
reproduced the missing token in the correct position as in the original sequence (Figures 2c and 2d).
13Figure 2a shows how memorization changes as a function of the frequency of occurrence of a sequence within
the training data when using CLM. Approximately 2% of the sequences that appear 2 times in the training
data are memorized whereas approximately 16% of the sequences that appear 50 times in the training data
are memorized. This progressive increase in memorization observed is consistent with previous work (Lee et al.
2022, Kandpal et al. 2022, Carlini et al. 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022). In Figure 2c, we show memorization
as a function of frequency using our denoising setup. That too, shows a monotonic increase similar to CLM.
To our knowledge, there has been no prior work that studied memorization in the context of a denoising
objective.
Overal, we observe the following,
•Memorization increases with frequency in the training data. This is consistent with the observations for
the GPT-family of models as well as PaLM (Carlini et al. 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022).
•Unlike what was observed for the GPT-family of models (Carlini et al. 2022), memorization does not
monotonically increase with context size.
Previous studies have shown that language models only regurgitate certain memorized sections of data under
the right conditions, usually determined by a precise context. Carlini et al. (2022) showed that for the
GPT-family, the model's tendency to reproduce chunks of tokens from the training data increased as a
function of the context size provided to the model. This also translates to an increase in the likelihood of
non-adversarial training data regurgitation (for example, the reproduction of exact copies of training data
during synthetic data generation) given larger contexts. In contrast to Carlini et al. (2022)'s observations for
GPT-3, we see that for AlexaTM 20B given increasing context size, memorization stays the same for CLM
and slightly decreases for denoising (cf. Figures 2b and 2d). This suggests that the denoising objective may
be breaking the memorization of longer contexts within the model. The use of a denoising objective during
pretraining might limit memorization given larger contexts.
As argued by (Chowdhery et al., 2022), whether memorization is problematic, depends on the level of
privacy required for the dataset and the downstream applications of the model. While posthoc privacy
auditing (Jagielski et al., 2020; Jayaraman & Evans, 2019; Nasr et al., 2021) and leakage mitigation processes
(Majmudar et al., 2022) can be used to limit the risk, users should in general be mindful when making
decisions on how and when large language models such as AlexaTM 20B are used for generation tasks.
8 Fairness and Bias Analysis
Previous work has shown that large-scale pre-trained language models (LMs) can demonstrate undesirable
biases (Sheng et al., 2021; Kurita et al.; Dev et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2022). In
this section, we conduct experiments to understand the potential harm of AlexaTM 20B, in the context
of representational bias (harmful negative generalization about a particular social group resulting from
stereotyping, that can propagate to model output and performance; Blodgett et al. 2020) and toxicity in
open-ended generation. This analysis is intended to provide users with a preliminary understanding of the
potential risks associated with using AlexaTM 20B.
8.1 Distributional Bias in Social Groups
8.1.1 Gender and Occupation Bias
Human biases and undesired social stereotypes exist in large pre-trained language models. One such bias is
the gender and occupation bias. Following (Chowdhery et al., 2022), we report this bias on the Winogender
benchmark. The Winogender benchmark is a coreference resolution task and measures gender bias in English
occupation nouns such as \nurse" and \engineer". Each example has an unambiguous reference. A commonly
14reported setting for this task is the multiple-choice scoring where the probability for dierent choices is
measured and the example is scored correct if the probability of the correct option is higher than other
options. We present results in the denoising and CLM modes and observe better performance in the denoising
mode. Prompt tuning can help improve the performance of the model and performance varies with slight
modications to the prompt especially in the zero-shot case. An example of prompt for multiple choice
scoring is shown in Appendix B.

occupation data
Table 14 reports the overall accuracy on the Winogender benchmark. The human performance on this task is
95.9% (Rudinger et al., 2018). We compare performance against the PaLM 540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)
and GLaM (Du et al., 2022) models in the one-shot setting. Zero shot numbers are strictly lower than these
reported numbers. AlexaTM 20B achieves a new state-of-the-art of 82.63% in the zero-shot setting in the
denoising mode. (Adding more shots, however, did not improve model performance.) The main reason
denoising mode performs better for this task is that in the denoising mode, the input is being repeated
in encoder and decoder allowing the model to use both encoder and decoder fully to nd the best answer.
Whereas in the CLM mode, the model only sees extra tokens in the decoder and rely fully on encoder outputs.
Following prior work, we also report the disaggregated accuracy on the \stereotypical" and \gotcha" subsets
(Rudinger et al., 2018) in Table 15. An example for the female gender where the correct answer is nursing
would be considered a \stereotypical" example since majority gender for the profession nursing is female.
The \neutral" subset comprises of examples with gender-neutral pronouns (\they", \their", \them"). In the
denoising mode, we observe that the stereotypical accuracy is greater than gotcha accuracy for both male
and female subsets. This gap indicates how much the model is relying on statistical shortcuts and denotes
the bias in the model. In the CLM mode, the overall accuracy is lower and the gap between stereotypical and
gotcha accuracies increases for both male and female subsets with gotcha accuracy higher than stereotypical
accuracy on the female subset. Accuracy is lowest on the gotcha examples for the male subset (71.66% and
57.5% for the Denoising and CLM modes respectively).

8.1.2 Toxicity and Bias
Similar to prior work, we use the procedure from (Brown et al., 2020a) where we analyze common descriptor
words in special prompt continuations such as \All ftermgpractioners are ...". The list of prompts used is
the same as used in (Chowdhery et al., 2022) For each prompt we generate 80 continuations using top-k
sampling with k=40 and a temperature value of 1.0. The descriptor words are obtained by running the spacy
(Honnibal & Montani, 2017) library on the prompt continuations and collecting the adjectives and adverbs.
Table 16 shows the top 10 most frequent unique descriptor words in response to prompt templates. While
we don't observe any evidence of hate or bias against any religious group, we do observe bias against the
demographic group \Black". The model generations also seem to perpetuate common stereotypes about
certain groups as is evidenced by adjectives such as \hard-working", \lazy", \motivated", \condent".
8.2 Toxicity in Open-Ended Generation
Following PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) which borrows the setup from (Welbl et al., 2021) and (Rae
et al., 2021), we randomly sample 10K prompts from RealToxicityPrompts dataset (Gehman et al., 2020)
and generate 25 continuations for each prompt with top-k sampling with k=40 and a temperature of 1.0
and measure the toxicity of the rst complete sentence continuation using the Perspective API. We plot
the average Toxicity Probability of Continuation (TPC) as a function of binned Toxicity Probability of
Prompt (TPP) for the AlexaTM 20B model in Figure 3. Similar to the earlier ndings we observe that TPC
increases with TPP i.e. toxic prompts lead the model to generate more toxic continuations. We also observe
that TPC is lower than TPP for majority of the cases and that TPC is lower than human baseline for low
toxicity prompts but as prompt toxicity increases TPC surpasses human baseline indicating that model starts
generating really toxic continuations with increasing prompt toxicity.
8.3 Remarks
Based on the analysis in Section 8, we found that AlexaTM 20B, similar to the observation in other large-scale
language models (Du et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), shows likelihood to generate
toxic language and amplify societal biases and harmful stereotypes. Therefore, we recommend that users
conduct a full task-specic fairness and bias analysis before using the model to fully understand and address
any potential harm that might arise from its use. Depending on the downstream application that AlexaTM
20B is being applied to, one or several of the prior techniques from literature (Gupta et al., 2022; Dathathri
et al., 2019; Dinan et al., 2019; Sheng et al., 2021; Dinan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a; Sheng et al., 2019;
Roller et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021; Dinan et al., 2021; Dhamala et al., 2021; Schick et al., 2021; Ouyang
et al., 2022) might be utilizable for detoxifying and debiasing the model. We re-iterate the importance of
16Figure 3: Toxicity probability of the continuation (TPC) as a function of Toxicity probability of the prompt
(TPP). The human baseline represents the toxicity probability of the original sentence continuation.
task-specic fairness auditing and emphasize the need for more research on bias measurement and mitigation
from the community.
9 Environmental Impact
Here, we show the environmental impact of training AlexaTM 20B compared to other large-scale language
models. We include the total compute time of pretraining, validation, hyper-parameter tuning, development,
and occasionally needing to resume from prior checkpoints during training when computing the environmental
impact of AlexaTM 20B.
We take carbon emission estimates for GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020b) from Patterson et al. (2021). For
PALM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), we use the carbon emissions they self-report. And for YALM (Khrushchev,
2022), we take the number of GPUs used and the number of days spent training they self-report, and use the
carbon footprint estimation method described in (Davy, 2021) to convert to carbon emissions.
Table 17 presents the carbon footprint of dierent models in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). As
can be seen, despite matching or outperforming GPT3 175B performance across dierent tasks, the AlexaTM
20B pre-training has 1 =5thof GPT3 carbon footprint. This points to another important factor in eciency of
AlexaTM 20B pre-training.
Moreover, as AlexaTM 20B is much smaller in size than models like GPT3 175B, yet achieving similar or
better performance across dierent tasks, the ongoing environmental impact of using AlexaTM 20B for
inference is much lower than that of larger models (roughly 8.7 times lower). Hence, overtime AlexaTM 20B
has lower carbon footprint as well.

10 Related Work
Self-supervised Pre-training Since the introduction of Transformer models ve years ago (Vaswani et al.,
2017), self-supervised pre-training of such models has driven massive performance gains across a wide variety
of NLP tasks. Large-scale pre-trained Transformers showed remarkable success in transfer learning from
pre-training to the downstream ne-tuning tasks, as initially demonstrated by BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)
and GPT (Radford & Narasimhan, 2018; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020b). BERT-style models
used Transformer encoder architecture and introduced the masked language modeling, a token-level denoising
objective which excelled at classication and sequence labeling tasks. GPT-style models used a Transformer
decoder-only trained with a left-to-right (causal) language modeling objective, tasked with generating the
next token, given the preceding context.
Since then, a variety of pre-training objectives have been studied and shown to be successful. Denoising
objectives included token masking or deletion, span inlling or dropout, token and sentence permutation,
token sequence rotation, etc. (Lewis et al., 2020; Rael et al., 2020; Song et al., 2019). There have also been
some eorts to combine encoder and sequence-to-sequence objectives (Dong et al., 2019; Bao et al., 2020).
Pre-trained Encoder-Decoder Transformers Several publicly released pre-trained models used encoder-
decoder architecture, including BART (Lewis et al., 2020), T5 (Rael et al., 2020), T0 (Sanh et al., 2021),
UniLM (Dong et al., 2019; Bao et al., 2020), and most recently, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022). However, the majority
of large-scale (15B+ parameters) models trained and published to date have used the Transformer decoder
architecture, and to the best of our knowledge, none to date explored multilingual zero-shot transfer with
very large sequence-to-sequence language models.
Multilingual models A number of encoder-style models have been pre-trained on multilingual data.
Pre-training on multilingual data and ne-tuning on the downstream data for one of the languages showed
an interesting pattern of zero-shot generalization to other languages. Pre-training a model on free text in
several languages with a jointly learned vocabulary, can be followed by ne-tuning, for example, on English
sentiment analysis data. The resulting ne-tuned models were shown to have remarkably good sentiment
analysis performance on other (non-English) languages (although decreased relative to English). Among
public multilingual encoders, the most successful eorts include mBERT (a version of BERT pre-trained on
Wikipedia in 104 languages), mBART (Liu et al., 2020b), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), and XGLM (Lin
et al., 2021).
In-context learning In-context learning (Brown et al., 2020b) has emerged as a viable alternative to the
pre-training/ne-tuning paradigm, particularly for very large generative language models. In this setting,
no additional training is performed, i.e., a pre-trained model is not ne-tuned on the downstream task, but
rather used for inference "out of the box". The model is prompted with a task description and one or several
examples of the desired output at inference time. The assumption is that conditioning generation on such
task-dening prompts allows the model to use pattern recognition learned at pre-training to recognize the
downstream task { and generate the correct output for it.
In-context learning abilities have been observed in models with over 15B parameters, and have been shown
18to increase progressively with scale, as the number of model parameters increases. At the same time, zero-
and few-shot performance of such models has been shown to be highly sensitive to the context provided to
the model in a prompt Prompt tuning and prompt design for in-context learning has become somewhat of an
art, and model performance obtained with dierent prompting strategies shows high variance.
11 Conclusion
In this work, we demonstrated that sequence to sequence (seq2seq) models when pre-trained on a mix
of denoising and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) tasks are very strong few-shot learners capable of
outperforming much larger decoder-only Language Models across various NLP tasks. Our results on English
NLP tasks agree with the concurrent work of Tay et al. (2022) demonstrating the power of seq2seq models
in few-shot learning (interestingly of the exact same size of 20B) when trained on a mix of denoising and
CLM tasks. This suggests that mixed pre-training, and not necessarily additional multitask training as
suggested by Wang et al. (2022), is the key to train strong seq2seq-based Large-scale Language Models (LLM).
Finally, we demonstrated that AlexaTM 20B is very strong in 1-shot Machine Translation (MT), especially
on non-English centric and low-resource languages, opening the door to more improvements on MT models
without a need for high quality parallel data using our proposed style of pre-training.

26A Extra Results
A.1 Machine Translation
We present MT results on Flores-101 using AlexaTM 4-shot in Table A1. As can be seen, we observe
improvements for some language pairs but not all when using more shots compared to 1-shot results. The
most gain was between Indic language pairs (i.e., Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu).

B Prompt and Evaluation Format used for Dierent Tasks
As described in Section 5, we can use AlexaTM 20B in dierent setting for in-context evaluation. In this
section, we provide the details on the mode and the prompt used for all the tasks presented in this work.
Tables A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 present the evaluation mode and a sample prompt used for model evaluation.
A1As we mentioned in Section 6.4, in zero-shot evaluation of AlexaTM 20B, we realized that adding dummy
examples can help the model generate output in the desired format related to each task. These dummy
examples are denoted in red in the Table A4.
