Large language model (LLM) research has grown rapidly, along with increasing concern about their limitations
such as failures in reasoning, hallucinations, and limited multilingual capability. While prior reviews have
addressed these issues, they often focus on individual limitations or consider them within the broader
context of evaluating overall model performance. This survey addresses the gap by presenting a data-driven,
semi-automated review of research on limitations of LLMs ( LLLMs ) from 2022 to 2025, using a bottom-up
approach. From a corpus of 250,000 ACL and arXiv papers, we extract 14,648 relevant limitation papers using
keyword filtering and LLM-based classification, validated against expert labels. Using topic clustering (via two
approaches, HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM), we identify between 7 and 15 prominent types of limitations
discussed in recent LLM research across the ACL and arXiv datasets. We find that LLM-related research
increases nearly sixfold in ACL and nearly fifteenfold in arXiv between 2022 and 2025, while LLLMs research
grows even faster, by a factor of over 12 in ACL and nearly 28 in arXiv. Reasoning remains the most studied
limitation, followed by generalization, hallucination, bias, and security. The distribution of topics in the ACL
dataset stays relatively stable over time, while arXiv shifts toward safety and controllability (with topics like
security risks, alignment, hallucinations, knowledge editing), and multimodality between 2022 and 2025. We
offer a quantitative view of trends in LLM limitations research and release a dataset of annotated abstracts
and a validated methodology, available at: github.com/a-kostikova/LLLMs-Survey.

1 Introduction
With the explosive growth of large language model (LLM) research and deployment [ 111], questions
of the limitations of LLMs ( LLLMs ) have also gathered increased interest, ranging from reasoning
failures [ 81], social bias [ 59], hallucinations [ 117], difficulty in handling long contexts [ 53], and
many more. Understanding where LLMs fail is essential for knowing how and whether they can be
safely and effectively used in real-world settings, especially as LLMs are increasingly deployed in
safety-sensitive domains such as healthcare, education, finance, and law [ 14]. Moreover, tracking
how these failure modes evolve over time helps reveal whether the fast-paced research landscape
is addressing them, overlooking them, or exposing new ones, offering a clearer picture of where
further research is most needed.
However, given the sheer size of LLM research, with thousands of published research papers
every year (even when limited to highly rated outlets), it is challenging to maintain an up-to-date
overview of LLLMs research using traditional, manual literature review techniques. Accordingly,
prior reviews on LLLMs mostly focus on specific limitations, such as reasoning [ 57,116], or examine

limitations within the broader context of evaluating overall model capabilities [ 9,96]. To date, the
field still misses an overview that covers the more recent LLM research between 2022 and now and
cuts across limitations. Our review is an attempt to provide this high-level overview.
To make our task feasible, we opt for a data-driven, bottom-up approach and build a partially
automated, systematic literature review pipeline. Starting from an initial set of almost 250,000
crawled papers from ACL (2022-2024) and arXiv (2022 through early 2025), we extract 14,648
papers that discuss LLLMs (filtering for keywords first, then classifying the papers’ abstracts with
an LLM, validated against human expert classifications). Finally, we cluster the papers using two
different methods (HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM) to understand which particular limitations
are researched. These approaches offer complementary strengths: the former provides single-label,
density-based clustering, while the latter uses multi-label, LLM-based assignments, allowing us to
cross-validate and reduce method-specific bias. Overall, our methods serve to apply quantitative
methods to surveying this vast field.
We observe four main results. i) LLLMs research has grown rapidly, outpacing even the growth
of LLM research overall. The number of LLM-related papers has grown by a factor of nearly 6 in
ACL and nearly 15 in arXiv between 2022-2025, reaching almost 80% of all crawled ACL papers
and roughly 30% of all crawled arXiv papers; LLLMs papers have increased even more sharply, by a
factor of over 12 in ACL and 28 in arXiv, accounting for more than 30% of LLM papers in Q1 of
2025. ii) Within LLLMs research, reasoning limitations are the most prominent, with generalization ,
hallucination ,bias, and security as further important concerns. iii) The distribution of limitations
appears relatively stable in the ACL dataset, whereas the arXiv dataset shows a rise in concern for
topics related to safety and controllability (e.g., Security Risks ,Alignment Limitations ,Knowledge
Editing ,Hallucination ) as well as Multimodality . (iv) Despite substantial methodological differences
between HDBSCAN and LlooM, we observe topical overlap in several of the biggest clusters (e.g.,
Reasoning ,Hallucination ,Security Risks ) across both approaches, with broadly similar trend patterns,
suggesting that these findings are reliable.
The contributions of this review to the field are i) a large-scale dataset of paper abstracts,
tagged with limitation information, for further research,1ii) an LLM-based paper annotation
methodology, validated against human experts, iii) most importantly, quantitative insights into the
evolution of LLLMs research covering the entire period 2022-2024 and early 2025, providing the
first comprehensive overview of LLLMs research for this period.
2 Related Work
2.1 Surveys of Large Language Models
A growing number of surveys have aimed to synthesize the rapid progress of LLMs, covering
their architectures, training paradigms, applications, and broader impact. Notably, Zhao et al . [125]
have become a widely adopted reference in the field, offering a structured overview along four
key dimensions: pre-training, adaptation, utilization, and evaluation. Other comprehensive works
expand on this foundation by discussing emerging areas such as multimodal LLMs, robotics, and
system efficiency [ 33,77], as well as reasoning and planning capabilities in large-scale models [ 69].
In parallel to cross-domain surveys, a number of studies have investigated how LLMs are being
adopted and evaluated in specific fields. In the medical domain, surveys examine the effectiveness
of LLMs in clinical summarization and diagnostic reasoning [ 46,104], as well as challenges related
to hallucination and factual consistency in medical question answering [ 83]. Other works explore
the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in capturing cultural commonsense knowledge [ 93] and
scientific research processes [ 22,64]. In recommendation systems, LLMs have been studied as both
1github.com/a-kostikova/LLLMs-SurveyLLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 3
retrieval and generation engines [114], while in information retrieval, surveys highlight their use
in query expansion, passage ranking, and answer synthesis [ 127]. LLMs have also been applied
to software engineering tasks such as code generation and bug fixing, with systematic reviews
discussing both their potential and practical limitations [ 36]. Beyond text-based applications, LLMs
have been integrated with structured resources such as knowledge graphs [44, 80] and studied in
the context of autonomous agent design [106].
While these surveys offer valuable perspectives on LLM usage and challenges within specific do-
mains, the literature remains fragmented with respect to how limitations are identified, categorized,
and compared. Our work is motivated by the need for a more systematic and scalable approach to
mapping research focused explicitly on the limitations of LLMs across domains and tasks.
2.2 Surveys on Limitations of LLMs
As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, a growing body of research has
emerged to examine their limitations from different capability-oriented perspectives. One promi-
nent area of concern are hallucinations, where recent surveys investigate underlying causes and
mitigation strategies in both text generation [ 38,39,102] and multimodal contexts [ 62,90,91]. An-
other major focus is reasoning, with surveys analyzing the development of novel techniques[ 37,84]
such as chain-of-thought prompting [ 13], reinforced reasoning [ 57,116], and mathematical problem-
solving [ 3]. In parallel, the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs have been studied through the
lens of fairness, transparency, and calibration [ 98], while other works concentrate on security and
privacy threats including adversarial vulnerabilities and data leakage [ 17,119]. A related thread
explores ethical risks in LLM-based agents, particularly concerning safety, misuse, and human
interaction [26, 43, 47].
Despite these valuable contributions, existing reviews typically focus on specific capabilities
or domains in isolation, often adopting distinct definitions, evaluation metrics, and analytical
frameworks. As a result, the broader landscape of LLM limitations remains fragmented, making it
difficult to compare findings or track emerging research trends. This underscores the need for a
more systematic and scalable approach to identifying and organizing literature across different
limitations of LLMs.
2.3 LLMs as Analytical Tools for Scientific Literature
We apply a partially automated pipeline, relying on LLMs to filter the papers included in our survey
and providing embeddings for clustering. Such methods have to be applied with care to avoid
being misled because of the very limitations this survey is supposed to study. In developing our
methodology, we rely on a growing literature of LLMs being used as instruments for analyzing
scientific literature [ 22]. Several recent approaches employ LLMs for topic modeling, semantic
clustering, and concept induction, enabling more interpretable organization of large-scale corpora
[20,24,48,82,124]. This has led to a growing number of systematic reviews that use BERTopic
and related methods to map research landscapes across areas such as generative AI, information
assurance, LLM applications, and research impact evaluation [6, 21, 27, 32, 50].
In addition to these analytical techniques, other efforts focus on automating synthesis of results
across papers. Systems such as SurveyX and AutoSurvey generate draft surveys from large pa-
per collections [ 58,108], while tools like LitLLM [ 2] and PaSa [ 35] support LLM-based retrieval,
summarization, and exploration of academic texts.
To enable a data-driven, bottom-up analysis of the vast field of LLLMs research, including several
ten thousand papers, we opt to apply some of the aforementioned automation techniques. However,
given the limitations of LLMs, we aim to validate each step of our method, either by comparing
to a human gold standard, or by comparing the outputs of different methods (hence, we use two4 Last Name et al.

clustering approaches). As such, we aim to be more conservative in our utilization of LLMs in
literature research compared to the prior work pointed out above.
3 Methodology
Fig. 1 illustrates the method for our systematic literature review. We begin by retrieving papers
from arXiv and ACL (Section 3.1), filter according to keywords (Section 3.2), filter papers further
by classifying their abstracts with an LLM (Section 3.3), and finally cluster the papers (Section 3.5).
At each step of the analysis, we perform validations to ensure the robustness of our results: the
keyword list is obtained with an iterative refinement procedure, the LLM classification step is
validated against a gold standard of 445 human-annotated papers, and we use two distinct clustering
methods for comparison (HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM). In the remainder of this section, we
describe each step in more detail.
3.1 Data Retrieval
Our initial dataset includes all academic papers published between January 2022 and March 2025,
sourced from the ACL Anthology and arXiv. ArXiv captures (potentially) non–peer-reviewed
research that closely tracks current developments, while ACL venues reflect peer-reviewed work
and remain the primary publication outlets for NLP research, where much of the foundational
work on LLMs originated. The time frame was chosen to capture the year preceding the release of
ChatGPT as well as all subsequent research on LLMs [125].
For ACL Anthology, we scrape conference pages for AACL 2022–2023, ACL 2022–2024, EACL
2023–2024, EMNLP 2022–2024, ICLR 2022–2024, NAACL 2022 and 2024, and TACL 2022–2024 as
the premier NLP venues.2For arXiv, we retrieve papers from the categories of Computation &
Language (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Computer Vision
2We exclude other tracks and venues such as workshops, system demonstrations, tutorials, shared tasks, and task-specific
venues (e.g., SemEval, CoNLL, WMT) to maintain a focus on high-impact research from general-purpose NLP conferences.LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 5

(cs.CV) because these communities are closest to LLM research. However, we note that many
papers are classified by the authors into multiple arXiv categories, so that research areas beyond
these initial ones are covered as well (see Section 4.4.3 for more details). Each entry includes
metadata such as title, publication date, author information, download link, and abstract, with arXiv
papers also containing all assigned categories. We use titles and abstracts for keyword filtering
and clustering, as they capture a paper’s main claims and contributions and are well-suited for
large-scale automated analysis. The final crawled dataset includes 245,835 papers (18,578 papers
for ACL, 227,257 for arXiv). Fig. 2 shows raw numbers of crawled ACL and arXiv papers over time.
3.2 Keyword-Based Filtering
In a first filtering stage, we exclude papers if no LLM-related keyword occurs in their title or
abstract. This step serves to avoid excessive resource needs in the later, more fine-grained filtering.
To identify keywords related to LLLMs research, we apply the following iterative approach:
(1) We use TNT-KID [68] to generate initial keywords for each abstract.
(2)Two manually reviewed sets of 50 LLM and 50 non-LLM papers are selected based on
predefined seed terms (e.g., LLM,large language model ).
(3)We compute log-likelihood ratio (LLR) scores for TNT-KID-generated keywords in both
sets. Keywords with LLR ≥25are added to the list.
(4)Using the updated list, we expand the dataset by adding 100 more papers to each set,
maintaining balance across venues and years while avoiding duplicates.
(5)Steps 3 and 4 repeat until all papers are processed. As more keywords are added, the rate of
new informative terms naturally decreases. To avoid including increasingly marginal or
noisy keywords in later iterations, we raise the LLR threshold by 5% whenever fewer than
5% of the keywords in the current round are new. This keeps the keyword list focused on
strongly distinctive terms as the process converges.
This results in a list of 90 keywords (19 unigrams, 44 bigrams, 16 trigrams, and 11 four-grams).
Overall, the final keyword set covers key aspects of LLM research (see the full list in Section A
supplementary material):6 Last Name et al.

We keep only those papers that contain at least one of the keywords in their title or abstract.
This results in 64,110 papers (8,635 for ACL, 55,475 for arXiv). A breakdown of crawled and filtered
papers across sources for each year is provided in Table 1. While this filtering step does not strictly
isolate LLM-focused papers, we observe that the proportion of papers passing the filter increases
over time, which may reflect a growing focus on LLMs in the broader NLP research landscape. We
examine this pattern in more detail in Section 4.2, where we analyze trends in both LLM and LLLMs
papers after additional filtering.
3.3 LLM-Based Filtering
In a second filtering stage, we apply an LLM to evaluate every abstract of the 64,110 papers left
after the first filtering stage and 1) rate how much LLLMs are discussed on a scale from 0 to 5, as
well as 2) extract text snippets that explicitly discuss limitations for papers rated 2 or higher. The
text snippets will later form the basis for clustering.
However, before we apply this filtering, we set up a human-annotated gold standard dataset to
check if LLMs are able to perform this filtering in the first place.
3.3.1 Human Annotation Task. For human annotation, we randomly select 445 papers from the
keyword-filtered dataset, balancing the source (ACL or arXiv, ensuring conference representation
within ACL) and publication year. Papers are manually annotated based on their titles and abstracts
to assess whether they discuss LLLMs . The human annotators rated each paper on a scale from
0-5, reaching from no relation to LLMs (0) to exclusive focus on LLLMs (5). Refer to Table 2 for the
detailed annotation guideline.LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 7

For papers rated 2-5, annotators highlighted textual evidence pointing to the limitation and
its domain, hereafter referred to as “evidence”. See Table 13 in the supplementary material for
representative examples of annotated papers and highlighted evidence.
Limitation rating agreement. We measure annotator agreement using:
(1) standard Cohen’s Kappa for raw agreement;
(2)quadratic weighted Cohen’s Kappa, which accounts for the ordinal nature of the 0–5 scale
by penalizing larger discrepancies more heavily.
The annotation process included multiple rounds, involving two professors (natural language
processing and machine learning), one PhD student (NLP), and one Master’s student (computer
science). Initial annotations showed moderate inter-annotator agreement (0.27 standard Cohen’s
Kappa, and 0.62 weighted), which was improved by further rounds (0.57, and 0.75, respectively),
indicating substantial agreement in the final version. Overall, the annotation process covered 445
samples (where 195 were annotated solely by a Master’s student after all discussion rounds).
The final rating for each paper is determined by rounding the average of annotators’ ratings.
The number of papers assigned to each label in the human-annotated dataset is shown in Table 2.
Table 3 displays the statistics of labels across years.
Evidence annotation agreement. We compare the evidence highlighted based on a representation
as BIO-tagged sequences, where tokens are labeled as B-EVID, I-EVID, or O (beginning, inside or
outside evidence, respectively). In our agreement analysis, we include any paper that is annotated
by at least two annotators, which was the case for 250 of the 455 annotated papers. We compute
agreement by means of the macro-averaged F1 score across annotator pairs, excluding cases where
neither annotator selected evidence.
On average, evidence agreement across the full jointly annotated dataset (ratings 0–5, 250 papers)
is 0.55 in terms of averaged pairwise F1. For papers explicitly discussing limitations (papers with
ratings 3–5 as a final label, 48 jointly annotated papers), F1 score increases to 0.71. This score
suggests reliable consistency, given the known difficulty of span-level annotation [19].8 Last Name et al.
3.4 Models and Prompting Evaluation
We evaluate models on the human-annotated dataset to identify the most effective model-prompt
configuration for scoring LLM limitation discussions and extracting supporting evidence. Consider-
ing both performance and cost, we select the best-performing one for full-dataset classification and
clustering of papers by limitation topics described in Section 4.
To represent different families and sizes of models, we evaluated three models and selected
the best performing one for full-scale annotation: GPT-4o selected as one of the best-performing
models at the time of analysis [ 15],Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 [40] as a small-scale open-weight
model and Llama-3.1-70b-Instruct [28] as a large-scale open-weight model.3We also compare
the results against a Logistic Regression baseline with SBERT embeddings [ 86], using random
sub-sampling validation with three 80/20 train–test splits, and applying SMOTE oversampling [ 11]
to mitigate class imbalance, with results averaged across splits.
To account for the impact of prompting on model performance, we experiment with different
strategies to determine the most effective approach:
•Prompt 1 : zero-shot baseline (no explicit rating rules).
•Prompt 2 : zero-shot with defined rating criteria.
•Prompt 3 : few-shot with defined rating criteria and five examples for each rating which
also include explanation for each rating.
Similar to human annotators highlighting evidence in abstracts to indicate discussions of LLLMs ,
models are prompted to extract supporting evidence from the text. Each prompt instructs the
model: “Please respond in the following format, providing a rating and supporting evidence for the
discussion of LLM limitations in each abstract. Do not include explanations, only cite the evidence
found in the abstract. ” Prompt 3, included as the most comprehensive, is available in Figure 14 of
the supplementary material.
Metrics and Evaluation. We compare model ratings to human ratings using weighted Cohen’s
Kappa for rating prediction. To evaluate evidence extraction, we compare the BIO sequence of
human annotators to the BIO sequence of models using averaged pairwise F1. Only papers rated
3–5 are included in the evidence evaluation.
3.5 Clustering
To identify patterns in LLLMs discussions, we apply two clustering approaches: (i) HDBSCAN [ 70]
+ BERTopic [ 29] and (ii) LLooM concept induction [ 48], and compare their results. We select these
algorithms in particular because they represent particularly distinct approaches to text clustering:
HDBSCAN + BERTopic assigns each paper to at most one cluster and does so based on a hierarchical
clustering in the embedding space. By contrast, LLooM derives topics first and then queries an LLM
for each paper-topic-combination whether the respective paper belongs to that respective topic,
thus permitting papers to belong to multiple clusters. We remain agnostic regarding the choice of
clustering algorithm and focus on findings that are consistent across both approaches to enhance
the robustness of our literature review. Below, we outline the data preparation process and describe
each clustering pipeline in detail.
Data preparation. As clustering material, we use not the full abstract but only the passages that
explicitly describe the LLM limitation the paper is concerned with, i.e. the evidence statements of
papers rated 3-5 as extracted in Section 3.3. To enrich the text representation for clustering, we
follow the approach of Viswanathan et al . [105] and generate keyphrases for each statement using

to summarize full documents, as our input already consists of concise excerpts.
GPT-4o. The model is prompted to “provide a comprehensive set of keyphrases describing the LLM
limitations discussed in a paper”, with no constraints on the number generated. For example:
Evidence: “We find that zero-shot CoT reasoning in sensitive domains significantly increases a
model’s likelihood to produce harmful or undesirable output [...]”[92]
Generated Keyphrases: “zero-shot CoT reasoning limitations”, “increased harmful output”,
“sensitive domains challenges”, “prompt format issues”
Each set of keyphrases is appended to the original evidence statement, and this combined text
serves as input to both clustering approaches. Figure 3 illustrates the respective pipelines.
Clustering pipeline 1: HDBSCAN + BERTopic. We employ a density-based clustering approach
using HDBSCAN+BERTopic. We follow the standard BERTopic pipeline [ 29]: we use OpenAI’s
text-embedding-3-large model to embed the combined evidence–keyphrase text, and reduce
the embedding using UMAP [ 71], retaining 10 dimensions for ACL and 5 for arXiv. Such low
dimensionality has been shown to be effective for HDBSCAN in prior work [89].
To ensure meaningful clusters and minimize spurious outliers, we tune UMAP, HDBSCAN and
BERTopic parameters separately for ACL and arXiv. We further apply a distance-based outlier
reassignment strategy after observing that many outliers were not true noise but semantically close
to existing clusters, suggesting misclassification by HDBSCAN. Full parameter settings and details
of the reassignment procedure are provided in Section B of the supplementary materials.
Finally, clusters are given descriptive names by GPT-4o, based on the top-ranked keywords
extracted by BERTopic for each cluster.
Clustering pipeline 2: LlooM. For the second clustering approach, we adapt the LLooM concept
induction method with modifications tailored to our use case. LlooM involves a process of sum-
marization, clustering, and LLM-based synthesis. It first summarizes documents into bullet points
(distill step), then clusters them using HDBSCAN. An LLM then generates a concept (a short,
human-readable label that describes the theme of the cluster) and inclusion prompt for each cluster
(synthesize step), which are used to score all documents for each concept via zero-shot prompting
on a 0–1 scale (score step). For further implementation details, we refer the reader to the original
LlooM paper. [48]
In our setup, we skip the distill step (summarization of input text into short bullet points), since
our dataset already consists of concise quotes from research papers. We generate two concepts per10 Last Name et al.

using text-embedding-3-large , while GPT-4o is used for concept synthesis and iterative review.
For final scoring, we employ Llama-3.1-70b-Instruct , and retain only those papers for which
the model assigns a 75% to 100% confidence score for a given concept.
4 Results
In this section, we report the results of the LLM-based filtering stage and the clustering stage of our
pipeline (Fig. 1). We begin, however, with the validation results of our LLM-based filtering stage,
comparing LLM classifications of abstracts to human annotations.
4.1 LLM-based filtering evaluation
Table 4 summarizes how well different models with different prompts align with human expert
annotations. We report quadratic weighted Cohen’s Kappa for limitation ratings and pairwise F1
for evidence extraction, measured between each annotator and the model for the best-performing
prompts.
As seen in the table, performance improves as prompts become more detailed across all models,
with Prompt 3 consistently resulting in the highest Kappa scores but Prompt 2 performing similarly
well across models, suggesting that models benefit from clear definitions but less from examples.
Overall, Llama-3.1-70b-Instruct shows the strongest agreement with human annotations,
achieving the highest weighted Kappa (0.74) for rating assignment, as well as the highest evidence
extraction F1 (0.65). For reference, human–human agreement reaches 0.75 for ratings and 0.71
for evidence extraction. GPT-4o follows closely, with a weighted Kappa of 0.72 and an evidence
extraction F1 of 0.64. While Mistral-7B outperforms the baseline (weighted Kappa: 0.43), it lags
behind Llama and GPT-4o , with a weighted Kappa of 0.60 and a much lower evidence extraction
F1 of 0.36. Taken together, these results indicate that Llama-3.1-70b andGPT-4o can serve as
reasonably reliable annotators in our setting, with agreement levels approaching those of human
annotators.
Error analysis. To better understand Llama’s performance in limitation rating beyond Kappa
scores, we examine its confusion matrix. Figure 4 shows that both humans and the model oftenLLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 11

confuse adjacent categories, such as 2 ↔3, 3↔4, which is expected given the ordinal nature
of the labels. Overall, the model tends to overestimate rather than underestimate discussions of
limitations. In some cases, it misses LLM mentions entirely, predicting label 0 where LLMs are
discussed (21 cases). Despite some misclassifications, the model rarely confuses clearly high-rated
papers (4–5) with clearly low-rated ones (0–2). This suggests that it can reliably separate papers
that meaningfully discuss LLLMs from those that do not.
Concerning evidence extraction , in most cases, the model correctly identifies limitations when
they are clearly stated and often fully matches human annotations exactly (Example 1 in Table 5).
Disagreements primarily stem from the model’s tendency to select only 1–2 key sentences, omitting
longer arguments that annotators capture (Example 2), or when it chooses full statements instead
of specific phrases (Example 3), occasionally even capturing content that humans overlook (for
example, the sentence “...these methods fail to generalize in very basic ways” was missed by a
human but selected by the model.)
AsLlama-3.1-70b-Instruct performed best in our evaluation, we select it for the subsequent

papers serve as input for the clustering analysis.
4.2 LLM and LLLMs Trends Over Time
Key Insights
•LLM research is growing rapidly: by late 2024, LLMs account for 75% of ACL papers and over
30% of arXiv papers.
•Research on LLLMs grew even more rapidly, with 1 in 3 LLM papers now addressing limitations.
Before we turn to clustering, we provide an analysis of the number of LLM-related papers (rating
1 or more) as well as limitations-focused papers (rating 3-5) over time. Figure 5 shows:

In both corpora, the (i) overall share of LLM-related papers has grown substantially since early
2023. This trend is particularly steep in ACL, where, by late 2024, over 75% of ACL papers are
related to LLMs. This suggests a notable shift in NLP research, with LLMs becoming central to the
field. In arXiv, growth is more moderate but consistent, hitting just above 30% of papers by the end
of the same period. The lower proportion in arXiv might be due to different levels of engagement
with LLM research across the categories in our study, as shown in Figure 17 in the supplementary
material. In cs.CL, LLMs are widely discussed, reaching 80% by early 2025, similar to ACL, while in
areas like cs.CV and cs.LG, their presence remains below 20%.
The (ii) share of limitation papers among LLM-related work has also grown notably. As shown in
Figure 5ii, the proportion of LLLMs research has steadily increased in both venues. In ACL, this
share climbs sharply through early 2024, peaking at nearly 38% before stabilizing around 35%. In
arXiv, the rise is more gradual, reaching approximately 30% by the end of 2024.
Overall, as LLM research accelerates, so does work on their limitations, indicating that the
community is not only developing or using new models but also, increasingly, engaging with their
risks and shortcomings.
In the following sections, we refine this analysis and examine these emerging discussions in
detail through topic clustering.

Fig. 6. Topics in ACL Anthology and arXiv, clustered using HDBSCAN + BERTopic. Percentages reflect each
topic’s proportion out of the total LLM limitation papers (2,387 in ACL and 12,261 in arXiv).
We find that, according to the HDBSCAN approach, ACL’s limitation discussions are dominated
by a single topic: Reasoning, which accounts for over one-third (36.4%) of all limitation-focused
papers. In contrast, arXiv presents a more balanced topical spread, with the most frequent themes
being Social Bias (16.8%), Security Risks (15.9%), and Reasoning (10.9%).
Several topics are shared across both corpora, including Hallucination ,Social Bias , and Security
Risks . However, arXiv also introduces a number of unique topics not observed in ACL, such as
Multimodality ,Healthcare Applications ,Multilinguality , and Computational Cost .
Figure 7i and Figure 7ii show the dominant terms for each limitation cluster in the ACL and
arXiv datasets; additionally, Table 7 and Table 8 present representative paper examples for some
of the ACL and arXiv clusters, respectively. In ACL, the Reasoning cluster includes core cognitive
tasks such as natural language understanding (NLU), inference, and logical analysis and reflects a
broad range of reasoning types (e.g., temporal, causal, etc.). It spans multimodal tasks (example 1 in
Table 7), visual question answering, and overlaps with multilinguality and benchmark design. In
arXiv, Reasoning appears more distinct from other topics, though it remains closely linked to NLU,
as shown by keywords like understanding andcognitive . Additionally, it includes prompt-related
terms such as chain-of-thought andprompt , pointing to the role of prompt engineering in enabling
complex reasoning. The content differences between ACL (wider topic) and arXiv (narrower topic)
may also explain why the reasoning cluster is much more prevalent in ACL compared to arXiv,
though this may also be a clustering artefact from HDBSCAN handling datasets differently.
Several clusters focus on the correctness and reliability of model outputs. The Hallucination
cluster addresses factual accuracy, including terms related to faithfulness, trust, and correctness
(e.g., example 2). It also appears in multimodal contexts, with frequent references to hallucinations
in image captioning and generation. The Security cluster highlights threats such as jailbreaks,
adversarial prompts, and backdoors (e.g., example 3 shows adversarial attacks that evade detectors
using prompt and synonym manipulation).
The Social Bias cluster focuses on fairness, representation, and demographic disparity, as evi-
denced by keywords such as fairness ,representation ,gender ,racial ,cultural , and demographic . It
also includes terms tied to ethical and political considerations, including ethical ,moral ,political ,LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 15

andsocietal . In arXiv, the prominence of prompt ,sensitivity ,reliability , and variability suggests an
emphasis on prompt-based bias mitigation [118].
Other clusters reflect technical constraints in model design and deployment. These include Long
Context (ACL) and Context & Memory Limitations (arXiv), which address failures on long inputs
and outputs, memory constraints, and, as a result, computational costs (example 6 in Table 7 and
example 8 in Table 8). The Generalization cluster captures similar issues related to robustness and
domain transfer (example 4).
Some clusters are specific to one dataset. In ACL, the Uncertainty cluster describes behavioral
instability, including prompt sensitivity, calibration errors, and limited self-correction. In arXiv,
additional clusters capture a wider range of specialized concerns: Multimodality ,Conversational Lim-
itations ,Multilinguality ,Code Generation ,Healthcare Application ,Computational Cost ,Benchmark
Contamination ,Knowledge Editing , and Quantization . These clusters reflect both domain-specific
challenges (e.g. Healthcare Application , which focuses on the use of LLMs in clinical settings and
is primarily concerned with their black-box nature, see example 10) and implementation-level
trade-offs. For example, Benchmark Contamination refers to test data leakage into training sets16 Last Name et al.
(example 12), Knowledge Editing focuses on updating model content without retraining (example 14),
andQuantization andComputational Cost concern scaling and deployment efficiency (examples 13
and 11).

Reasoning“However, applying this [common-sense] reasoning to multimodal domains, where
understanding text and images together is essential, remains a substantial challenge.” (ACL
2024 [81])
(2)
Hallucination“Challenges on hallucination and factual inconsistency continue to impede their [LLMs’]
wider real-world adoption. [...] However, challenges remain, particularly regarding...
generating information not present in the evidence (hallucination).” (EACL 2024 [65])
(3)
Security“The prevalence and strong capability of large language models (LLMs) present significant
safety and ethical risks if exploited by malicious users. [...] Experiments reveal that our
attacks effectively compromise the performance of all detectors in the study with plausible
generations [...].” (TACL 2024 [95])
(4)
Generalization“LLMs are generally trained on publicly available text and code and cannot be expected to
directly generalize to domain-specific parsing tasks in a zero-shot setting [...].” (EMNLP
2023 [73])
(5)
Social Bias“We find that masked language models capture societal stigma about gender in mental
health: models are consistently more likely to predict female subjects than male in
sentences about having a mental health condition (32% vs. 19%) [...].” (EMNLP 2022 [59])
(6)
Long
Context“However, they face challenges in managing long documents and extended conversations,
due to significantly increased computational requirements, both in memory and inference
time [...].” (EMNLP 2023 [53])
(7)
Uncertainty[...] “We find that methods aimed at improving usability, such as fine-tuning and
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, can lead to miscalibration and unreliable natural
language explanations.” (NAACL 2024 [122])
While HDBSCAN provides an interpretable, unsupervised clustering approach, it has several
limitations for trend analysis. HDBSCAN assigns each paper to only one cluster and becomes
increasingly fragmented as more clusters are added (especially in ACL) making it difficult to capture
overlapping limitations or analyze trends at finer topical granularity. To address these issues, we
now turn to the LlooM approach, which supports multi-label assignment and allows for broader
topical coverage. The following section presents the main findings using LlooM, including trend
analysis of LLLMs topics; additional trend results from HDBSCAN are included in Section C in the
supplementary material for completeness.

Key Insights
•LlooM identifies a more fine-grained set of topics than HDBSCAN: 13 topics for ACL, including
new topics like Multimodality ,Language and Culture , and Knowledge Editing ; and 15 for arXiv,
adding concerns such as Alignment ,Trustworthiness , and Generalization .
•Reasoning ,Generalization , and Hallucination are top-ranking topics in both ACL and arXiv.
Beyond these shared concerns, ACL places additional emphasis on Knowledge Editing , while
arXiv is led by Trustworthiness andAlignment .
Figure 8 shows the distribution of LLM limitation topics in the ACL and arXiv datasets as
identified by the LlooM method. The share of outliers is 7.5% in ACL and 6.7% in arXiv.
In ACL, Reasoning remains the most prominent topic (26.3%), followed by Generalization (24.8%)
andKnowledge Editing (21.2%). Compared to HDBSCAN, the distribution across top limitations
appears more balanced and can be explained by the fact that LlooM allows papers to belong to mul-
tiple clusters. ArXiv is led by Trustworthiness (21.0%), followed by Reasoning (13.2%), Generalization
(10.1%), as well as Alignment Limitations ,Hallucination , and Bias and Fairness , which appear at
nearly equal levels ( ∼7.9%).18 Last Name et al.

Fig. 8. Topics in ACL Anthology and arXiv, clustered using LlooM approach. Percentages reflect each topic’s
proportion out of the total LLM limitation papers (2,387 in ACL and 12,261 in arXiv). Since papers can be
associated with multiple topics, the percentages may exceed 100% in total.
A number of topics are specific to LlooM. These are listed below, with explanations based on the
prompts used by LlooM to guide topic assignment (see Table 14 and Table 15 in the supplementary
material). For each cluster, we also provide representative paper examples in Table 9.
•Trustworthiness (arXiv): the largest cluster in the arXiv set (Figure 8). This category de-
scribes concerns about the reliability, transparency, and reproducibility of LLM outputs (see
example 20 which refers to concerns about the reliability of outputs generated by LMs). As
a broad category, it often overlaps with related issues like hallucination or alignment, as
discussed further in Section D of the supplementary material.
•Generalization (arXiv): Previously ACL-only in HDBSCAN, this cluster now appears in
arXiv as well. It captures failures across domains or tasks; e.g. example 19 shows reliance
on shallow heuristics over true generalization.
•Alignment Limitations (arXiv): Highlights challenges in aligning LLMs with human values
or safety protocols (see example 20 which discusses how models can generate outputs that
are untruthful, toxic, or unhelpful despite alignment efforts).
•Prompt Sensitivity (arXiv): Highlights performance instability when prompts are minimally
edited.
•Language and Cultural Limitations (ACL): difficulties in handling multilingual input, low-
resource languages, or culturally specific content, previously grouped under the Reasoning
cluster in HDBSCAN.
•Overconfidence (arXiv): Captures cases where LLMs express high certainty despite being
incorrect, often due to poor calibration (example 22 shows how persuasive language can
mask factual errors). This topic is closely related to the Uncertainty cluster identified in
ACL under HDBSCAN.
•Knowledge Editing (ACL & arXiv): efforts to modify, correct, or update model knowledge
post-training: for instance, example 15 (ACL) in Table 9 introduces methods for editing
factual content without retraining.LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 19
•Privacy Risks (ACL & arXiv): previously part of the Security cluster in HDBSCAN for both
datasets, this now is a distinct category in LlooM. It captures risks of leaking sensitive train-
ing data via model outputs or queries. Example 21 (arXiv) demonstrates privacy breaches
from pretraining on sensitive data.
•Multimodality (ACL): challenges in integrating and reasoning over inputs from different
modalities, such as text and images (example 16, ACL), previously grouped under the
Reasoning cluster in HDBSCAN.
•Computational Cost (ACL): the high memory, compute, and energy demands of training or
deploying LLMs (example 17).
•Data Contamination (ACL): inflated evaluation results caused by overlap between training
and test datasets. While this topic appeared in arXiv under HDBSCAN (as Benchmark
Contamination ), LlooM identifies it only in ACL (see example 18 which highlights concerns
about memorization skewing evaluation).
In summary, the LlooM clustering identifies a broader set of limitation types than HDBSCAN,
including implementation-level issues (e.g., Privacy ,Computational Cost ) and behavioral factors
(e.g., Overconfidence ,Prompt Sensitivity ) that were previously grouped under broader categories.
It also reflects some dataset-specific shifts, such as Generalization appearing in arXiv and Data
Contamination in ACL. In the next section, we examine how attention to these topics has changed
over time.
4.4.2 Trend Analysis. In this section, we discuss three perspectives on topic dynamics over time:
(i)LLM-wide share , measured annually as𝑁lim
𝑘,𝑦
𝑁LLM𝑦, to reflect how often limitation topic 𝑘appears
in LLM research in year 𝑦, relative to the total LLM papers. This shows whether a topic
is gaining attention beyond limitations research and becoming part of the general LLM
research agenda.
(ii)Limitations share , measured quarterly as𝑁lim
𝑘,𝑞
𝑁lim𝑞, to reflect the share of limitation-focused
papers in quarter 𝑞that address topic 𝑘. Note the different denominator compared to the
LLM-wide share (i): this metric is limited to the subset of limitation-focused papers to show
the topic’s visibility within the limitations-focused subfield.
(iii) Notable shifts in topic trajectories, such as spikes, dips, and periods of stabilization.
Here,𝑁lim
𝑘,𝑦is the number of limitation papers on topic 𝑡in year𝑦;𝑁LLM
𝑦is the total number of LLM
papers in that year; and 𝑁lim
𝑘,𝑞,𝑁lim
𝑞are the number of limitation papers on topic 𝑘and the total
number of limitation papers, respectively, in quarter 𝑞.
(i) How are limitation topics represented in the broader growth of LLM research?
Key Insights
•The presence of limitation topics in LLM research is increasing across both ACL and arXiv
datasets. Topics like Hallucination ,Multimodality , and Long Context surge in 2023 and 2024,
while longer-standing ones like Reasoning grow more gradually and consistently over time.
•However, this rise may simply reflect the rapid growth of the limitation field itself.
We begin by examining how visible different limitation topics are across the broader LLM
research field. Figure 9 shows the annual distribution of LLM limitation topics across ACL and
arXiv, normalized by all LLM-focused papers. These proportions reflect the overall visibility of each
topic. Additionally, to capture how visibility changes over time, we compute the relative percentage20 Last Name et al.
Table 9. Representative limitation-focused papers from ACL and arXiv, grouped by topic. Only topics identified
by LlooM and absent from HDBSCAN-based analyses are included. The numbers in parentheses in the “Topic”
column indicate the example ID referenced in the main text.

Share 𝑦×100, where
Share 𝑦refers to the LLM-wide share of a given topic in year 𝑦, i.e., the proportion of all LLM papers
that address that topic (see Table 16 in supplementary material).
As seen in Figure 9, most limitation topics show an increase in visibility within LLM research
over the years. However, topics differ in how their share of LLM research changes over time. Some
concerns surged in visibility within LLM research at specific moments (more than doubling in
share), such as Multimodality (+133%), Long Context (+108%), Catastrophic Forgetting (+140%) in
ACL 2024, and Hallucination (+223%), Security Risks (+163%), and Alignment Limitations (+102%) on
arXiv in 2023, reflecting heightened attention to certain types of LLLMs following widespread LLM
deployment. Others, like Reasoning andKnowledge Editing , show steadier growth across venues.
Meanwhile, topics such as Bias and Fairness andLanguage and Cultural Limitations peaked in ACL
2023 but declined in 2024 (from +70% and +36% to –5% and +8%, respectively), while concerns like
Prompt Sensitivity andOverconfidence on arXiv fell steadily after brief spikes. Since the data for
2025 data is incomplete, recent drops should be interpreted with caution.
Overall, LLM-normalized trends confirm that limitation topics are becoming more prevalent
within the broader LLM research. Most topics show growth, some slower, some rapidly. However, aLLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 21

topic’s increasing presence in LLM research may simply reflect the overall expansion of limitation
research, rather than increased relative focus on that specific topic. Therefore, in the next bullet
point, we examine whether these trends hold within limitation-focused work.
(ii) What are the trends within LLM limitation research?

Fig. 10. LLLMs topics trends for the ACL dataset based on LLooM clustering approach. Note that y-axis limits
vary across subplots to reflect differences in topic prevalence and improve visualization.
Figure 10 shows how the distribution of limitation topics within the ACL dataset has changed
over time. We evaluate the significance of these trends using the Mann-Kendall test [ 45,67] for
monotonic trend detection.
•↑Increasing: Long Context shows an upward trend, rising from around 2% in 2022-Q2 to a
peak of 10% by 2024-Q3. This trend is statistically significant according to the Mann-Kendall
test (𝜏= 0.51,𝑝= 0.0491). Security Risks also shows a similar upward trajectory ( 𝜏= 0.47),
though it does not reach significance at the 𝑝<0.05threshold.
•↓Decreasing: No topics show statistically significant declines. However, Bias and Fairness
drops from∼17% to 10%, and Language and Cultural Limitations from∼20% to 12% between
2023-Q2 and 2024-Q4. Computational Cost , after a steady rise in the period from late 2022
to late 2023, decreases from ∼5% in the late 2023 to below 5% by 2024-Q4. None of these
changes are statistically significant.
•→ Stable or Fluctuating: Most topics remain steady over time: Reasoning ,Generalization ,
andHallucination fluctuate between 10–35%, while Knowledge Editing varies more widely
(18–39%) and Multimodality stays between 6–11%, with a slight increase after early 2024.
Privacy Risks (3–6%), Security Risks (peaking at 15% in 2022-Q3 but mostly under 10%), and
Catastrophic Forgetting (below 5%) remain consistently low.
For the arXiv dataset, we observe the following trends over time according to LlooM (Figure 11):
•↑Increasing: Multimodality ,Security Risks ,Alignment Limitations , and Knowledge Editing
all show statistically significant upward trends according to the Mann-Kendall test ( 𝑝<0.05).
Multimodality rises from approximately 2% in 2022 to nearly 10% by late 2024, Security Risks
increases from around 9% to 11%, and Alignment Limitations grows from a post-2022 dip to

Hallucination also shows a positive trend ( 𝜏= 0.38), but this increase is not statistically
significant under the Mann-Kendall test.
•↓Decreasing: Generalization declines from around 35% in the second quarter of 2022 to
20%, and Bias and Fairness drops from a peak near 25% to ∼13%. Both of these downward
trends are statistically significant ( 𝑝<0.05).
•→ Stable or Fluctuating: Most remaining topics show no significant directional movement.
Reasoning stays around 20–30%, Trustworthiness holds at 40–45%, and Overconfidence ,Long

10% to∼5% (2023–2025), while Hallucination andLanguage and Cultural Limitations rise
modestly and then level off. Catastrophic Forgetting stays consistently below 4%.
These results confirm that not all LLM-wide trends carry over into increased focus within
limitation-specific research. While some topics, such as Multimodality ,Security Risks ,Alignment
Limitations , and Knowledge Editing , do show consistent growth within limitation-focused work, the
majority remain flat or variable despite gaining visibility across the broader LLM field, as discussed
earlier. However, the Mann-Kendall test only captures consistent upward or downward trends, not
short-term changes, which may explain why topics like Security Risks (ACL) and Hallucination
(arXiv) show visible growth without being statistically significant. We examine these kinds of
short-term spikes and dips in the next paragraph.
(iii) How do topics shift in ways not captured by overall trends?
Key Insights
•Limitation topics stabilize around 2023-Q2, either plateauing or beginning steady growth, after
earlier volatility. For example, technical concerns (e.g., Hallucination ,Alignment Limitations ) rise
and plateau, while social topics decline after 2023-Q2.
•This shift coincides with rising paper volume and the release of ChatGPT and other major models
in early 2023.24 Last Name et al.
Across both ACL and arXiv, 2023-Q2 marks a shift in the LLLMs research (Figure 10, Figure 11).
Before this, topic shares are volatile (see e.g. a spike in Security Risks in 2022-Q3), particularly in
ACL. After early 2023, topics begin to stabilize across both datasets: Reasoning levels off, General-
ization remains flat or slightly declines before stabilizing, and newer concerns like Security Risks ,
Hallucination , and Alignment Limitations rise sharply and then plateau. Multimodality stabilizes
somewhat later, starting a steady increase in ACL around early 2024, but earlier in arXiv (around
Q2 2023). In contrast, socially focused topics such as Bias and Fairness andLanguage and Cultural
Limitations decline in share after mid-2023, reflecting the integration of new concerns into the
discourse.
The stabilization of topic trends coincides with a sharp rise in raw paper counts beginning
in 2023 (see Figure 16), indicating not just increased research volume, but a shift toward a more
coherent field. Before 2023-Q2, most topics appear in fewer than 25 ACL papers and under 100 in
arXiv, making early signals harder to interpret. This growth aligns with the release of ChatGPT
in November 2022, as well as the emergence of other major models like GPT-4 [ 1], PaLM [ 16],
and LLaMA [ 103] between February and July 2023, which likely contributed to the expansion and
differentiation of LLM limitations research during this period.
4.4.3 LLLMs Topics Distribution Across ArXiv Categories. Our analysis shows that LLLMs span a
broad range of concerns, from reasoning and generalization to bias, safety, and multimodality.
ArXiv’s category system offers a way to examine how different research communities engage with
these topics. We analyze topic distributions across categories to understand where this work is
published and which concerns dominate in specific domains.
In our dataset, most LLLMs papers are concentrated in cs.CL (Computation & Language; 58.7%),
followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence; 8.7%), cs.CV (Computer Vision; 6.6%), and cs.LG (Ma-
chine Learning; 3.3%). This is expected, since these categories were used as our arXiv search criteria.
Notably, we also observe papers with categories like cs.CY (cybersecurity), cs.SE (software engi-
neering), and cs.HC (human-computer interaction), which appear as a result of multi-categorization.
Although many categories share topics such as Trustworthiness ,Reasoning ,Generalization , and
Alignment Limitations , both their overall topic composition and temporal dynamics vary by field.
Figure 18 (right) in the supplementary material, shows how topic shares differ across arXiv cate-
gories, while Figure 12 illustrates how topics in the four largest categories evolve over time. Key
trends in the largest categories are as follows:
•cs.CL (Computation and Language) covers nearly all LLLMs , with Reasoning dominating
across the full time range. Bias and Fairness rises mid-2023, but is overtaken by Hallucination
by the end of the year. Other topics like Security andMultimodality remain marginal.
•cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) follow similar distributions
tocs.CL , but put more weight on Security Risks (10.8% in cs.LG, 9.1% in cs.AI). In cs.LG,
this topic rises sharply in late 2023, reflecting growing concern with adversarial attacks.
In contrast, cs.AI shows more fluctuation, alternating between a focus on Reasoning and
Security Risks , indicating a split between safety and inference evaluation concerns.
•cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) diverges from the others in its dominant
focus on Multimodality (21.7%), which becomes the leading limitation category from early
2023 onward, driven by the rise of vision-language models. Hallucination andReasoning
remain present but secondary.
Beyond the four primary categories included in our analysis, several smaller arXiv categories
show up, often exhibiting a clear focus on domain-specific concerns. Figure 13 highlights six
such cases. cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) emphasize
value alignment and societal impact, with high shares of Social Bias andAlignment Limitations ,LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 25

reflecting ethical and user-centered concerns. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is dominated by
Security Risks (57.7%), consistent with its focus on adversarial threats and privacy vulnerabilities.
cs.IR (Information Retrieval) distributes attention across Hallucination ,Reasoning , and Knowledge
Editing , likely due to challenges in document-grounded generation and factual consistency. cs.SE
(Software Engineering) frequently discusses Reasoning andGeneralization , which aligns with LLMs26 Last Name et al.
used in code generation and developer tooling. Finally, cs.RO (Robotics) highlights Reasoning and
Multimodality , reflecting perception and control challenges in embodied settings. Though smaller
in volume, these categories reflect more targeted concerns tied to specific application domains.
Together, these disciplinary patterns illustrate how research on LLLMs is not only growing, but
also diversifying in focus based on domain needs.
4.5 Method and Output Comparison: HDBSCAN vs. LlooM
The aforementioned topic distributions differ depending on the clustering method. In this section,
we compare the two approaches used, HDBSCAN+BERTopic (see Section C in the supplementary
material) and LlooM (see Section 4), to identify which findings are stable and which may be method-
specific. We first compare trend agreement, then examine methodological differences to better
explain any observed divergences in their results.
To compare the trends, we report (i) Kendall’s Tau for each individual topic (as determined in
the trend analyses in Section C in the supplementary material and Section 4) to assess alignment
in trend direction and significance, and (ii) the Spearman correlation of the time series between
matched topics from HDBSCAN and LlooM to assess the similarity of overall trend shapes. To
identify matching topics between HDBSCAN and LlooM, we select the best match for each cluster
based on identical or semantically similar names. To validate these matches, we compute the Jaccard
overlap between their associated paper sets. Specifically, for each cluster produced by HDBSCAN,
we compute its Jaccard similarity with all LlooM topics, and vice versa. Given two paper sets 𝑋from
HDBSCAN and 𝑌from LlooM, the Jaccard similarity is defined as Jaccard(𝑋,𝑌)=|𝑋∩𝑌|
|𝑋∪𝑌|. We select
the top-1 Jaccard score for each cluster, representing its highest similarity with any topic from the
other method. Best-matching topic pairs are shown in Table 17 and Table 18 in the supplementary
material, confirming that major topics identified by name also show substantial paper overlap.
Trend Alignment Between HDBSCAN and LlooM. Table 10 summarizes trend agreement between
the two clustering approaches across matched topics in the ACL and arXiv datasets.
In the ACL dataset , 4 out of 6 matched topics (67%) share the same trend direction between
HDBSCAN and LlooM based on Kendall’s Tau. However, only half of these (33% overall) are also
aligned in trend significance. Spearman 𝜌values for trend shape similarity are generally moderate
to low and mostly not significant, with the exception of Security /Security Risks .
The arXiv dataset shows strong overall agreement between the HDBSCAN and LlooM clustering
approaches. Most topics demonstrate matching trend directions according to Kendall’s Tau (6 out
of 8 topics, 75%), and the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations also correlate strongly, as reflected by high
Spearman𝜌values. For instance, Multimodality (𝜌=0.86) and Multilinguality (𝜌=0.92) achieve
strong and statistically significant trend similarity across methods. Nonetheless, slight divergences
remain: although trend directions often align, significance levels or trend shapes occasionally differ.
For example, Hallucination trends upward in both methods but is statistically significant only in
HDBSCAN, with a moderate but insignificant trend similarity ( 𝜌=0.55). One notable case of strong
disagreement is Long Context , which displays both opposing trend directions and poor trend shape
similarity (𝜌=−0.22). These stronger results may reflect the greater reliability of the arXiv dataset
due to its larger size, in contrast to the smaller ACL sample.
Sources of Divergence Between HDBSCAN and LlooM. Although trend agreement between HDB-
SCAN and LlooM is stronger in the arXiv dataset compared to ACL, it is still not fully consistent
across all topics. These differences likely reflect methodological differences between the clustering
pipelines. To better understand this, we compare HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM in Table 11LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 27

across both datasets. We report overall clustering characteristics (e.g., number of topics) and align-
ment metrics: (i) average top-1 Jaccard scores across clusters for topic-level similarity, and (ii)
Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) for structural agreement.4
Compared to HDBSCAN, LlooM achieves slightly higher coverage of papers across both datasets
due to multi-topic assignment. Moreover, the topic-level Jaccard overlaps between methods are
only moderate (0.313 for ACL, 0.244 for arXiv), and overall structural alignment, as measured by
AMI, remains relatively low (0.229 for ACL, 0.221 for arXiv).
These results suggest that while LlooM and HDBSCAN identify similar broad limitation areas,
they organize papers differently at a finer-grained level. This pattern is further supported by Table 17
and Table 18 in the supplementary material, which show the most closely aligned topics across
methods. Some large limitation areas appear relatively stable across clustering strategies: e.g. topics
such as Reasoning ,Hallucination ,Security Risks , and Bias and Fairness align well across datasets
4AMI compares how often data points are grouped similarly, while adjusting for the similarity that would be expected by
random chance. To account for LlooM’s multi-topic assignments, we compute a shuffle-based baseline: for each paper, we
randomly select one of its LlooM topics and compare it to the HDBSCAN label. This process is repeated over 10 runs, and
we report the mean and standard deviation.28 Last Name et al.

and clustering approaches ( 𝐽>0.4), whereas smaller topics, such as Overconfidence andPrompt
Sensitivity , are often merged into broader categories (e.g., Hallucination ). This reflects differences in
clustering granularity: LlooM tends to split topics into overlapping subcategories, while HDBSCAN
merges related issues into broader clusters. For instance, HDBSCAN combines LlooM’s Security
Risks ,Privacy Risks , and Trustworthiness into a single Security topic.
While broad limitation areas and general trend directions are reliably identified across HDBSCAN
and LlooM, finer-grained topic structures and trend significance vary depending on the clustering
method, which highlights that clustering choice impacts the interpretation of limitation trends. We
return to these methodological considerations in Section 5.
5 Discussion and Conclusion
Based on the detailed results in Section 4, we conclude four major findings.
1. LLM limitation research grew rapidly in 2022-2025, outpacing even the overall growth of LLM
research. LLM research now dominates NLP and increasingly influences neighboring fields: by the
end of 2024, over 75% of ACL papers and more than 30% of arXiv submissions across cs.CL, cs.AI,
cs.LG, and cs.CV focus on LLMs, with growth continuing into 2025. Within arXiv, LLM engagement
in cs.CL closely mirrors ACL trends (reaching 80%), while areas like cs.CV and cs.LG remain below
20% but show steady growth. While only about 10% of LLM-related papers in early 2022 focused on
limitations, the fraction increased to about one third by 2025. This growth in LLLMs research may
indicate a maturation of LLM research: the very early enthusiasm for LLMs and their capabilities,
driven by the public deployment of systems like ChatGPT, is now increasingly accompanied with a
more critical perspective towards limitations [ 31]. Meta-analyses confirm this trend, showing a
sharp rise in evaluation-focused papers from 2020 to 2023 [9].
2. Within LLLMs research, reasoning is the most frequent topic, but research is diverse. Reasoning is
the most frequent limitation topic in ACL across both clustering approaches and remains among
the top concerns in arXiv, ranking third in HDBSCAN and second (after Trustworthiness ) in LlooM.
Other prominent topics include Generalization ,Hallucination ,Bias, and Security .
Beyond these, LLM limitation research is notably diverse. Our clustering analyses (HDBSCAN
and LlooM) reveal a broad spectrum of concerns, ranging from code generation and benchmark
contamination toprompt sensitivity andlong context . This breadth reflects the current state of LLM
limitation research: a fast-growing, methodologically diverse field still defining its major challenges.
Additionally, as shown in Section D in the supplementary materials, many papers address multiple
limitations simultaneously, reflecting the complexity of emerging concerns.
3. The distribution of limitations appears relatively stable in the ACL dataset, whereas the arXiv
dataset shows a rise in concern for topics related to safety and controllability. This contrast is nuanced
and is reflected in two key trends, discussed below.LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 29
3.1 Emerging trends in LLLMs research. Our trend analysis reveals mixed dynamics within LLLMs
research over the studied time period. Safety and controllability concerns (e.g., Security Risks ,
Alignment Limitations ,Knowledge Editing ,Hallucination ), model capacity advances (e.g., Long
Context in ACL), and Multimodality generally rise over time. In contrast, topics like Bias and
Fairness decline, while others remain flat. Notably, we observe a shift around 2023-Q2, following the
release of models like ChatGPT. After this point, early fluctuations diminish, topics that had been
growing continue at a steadier pace, and the decline in certain areas becomes more pronounced.
These trends align with shifting priorities in the LLM community. The growing attention to
alignment andsecurity reflects their increasingly central role in both training and evaluation of
LLMs. Though still relatively new and unsettled [ 94], these concerns became prominent in 2022 with
the rise of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which is now foundational in the
training pipelines of major models [ 109]. Yet ensuring safety without compromising performance
remains an open challenge [85, 100], making this an active and fast-moving research area.
3.2. Limitations persist as applications expand. As LLMs are deployed in high-stakes domains,
interest in hallucination andknowledge editing is growing due to the increasing demand for factual
accuracy and controllability. These remain deeply challenging: hallucination is increasingly seen
as an inherent property of LLMs, rooted in model architecture itself [8, 117].
Finally, these challenges grow as models move beyond text. The rise of multimodality -related
limitations suggests that LLMs not only inherit existing issues but also encounter new ones with
inputs like images and audio [ 121]. This trend likely reflects growing interest caused by the release
of GPT-4V [ 1], LLaVA [ 61], and other vision-language models in mid-2023. This and other trends
discussed above coincide with broader shifts already noted in previous studies of the arXiv corpus:
from early 2023 to late 2024, top-cited LLM papers increasingly came from cs.CV and cs.LG, with
cs.CL seeing a relative decline [ 49]. Similarly, authorship diversified, with many newcomers from
computer vision, security, and software engineering [75].
4. Despite methodological differences, HDBSCAN and LlooM identify overlapping high-frequency
topics (e.g., Reasoning, Hallucination, Security Risks) and similar trend patterns, pointing to the stability
of the main findings. We validate our results by comparing HDBSCAN+BERTopic (single-topic,
density-based) with LlooM (LLM-based, multi-topic). Despite methodological differences, both
clustering approaches identify the high-frequency topics, most notably Reasoning ,Hallucination ,
andSecurity Risks , showing substantial agreement in both topic composition and trend trajectories.
And although smaller topics (e.g., Prompt Sensitivity ) and trend significance can vary, the main
trends reported in this study appear stable across methods.
Limitations and Future Work
While our analysis involves multiple datasets and clustering approaches, several methodological
and temporal constraints should be kept in mind when interpreting the results:
•Although Llama-3.1-70B performs near human level in annotating limitation relevance,
it still slightly lags, particularly in extracting supporting evidence, possibly leading to
missed or incorrect information. However, as noted in Section 4.1, human annotators also
overlooked some cases, suggesting that some level of imprecision is inherent to the task.
•Both of our clustering approaches are prone to some instability. LlooM can be variable
due to its reliance on LLM outputs, a limitation noted by its authors as well [ 48]. HDB-
SCAN+BERTopic might also show some run-to-run variability, stemming from the stochastic
nature of UMAP and sensitivity to embedding changes. While high-level patterns are gen-
erally stable, topic composition and temporal trends may shift slightly. We mitigate these
issues by validating results across both methods.30 Last Name et al.
•While we adopt a broad definition of LLMs in both automated and human annotation (in-
cluding transformer-based, foundational, multimodal models), this scope may still introduce
bias, e.g., we may not capture newly emerging terms in fields such as computer vision.
•Our trend analysis for the arXiv dataset includes data up to early 2025. Therefore, apparent
declines or plateaus in the latest quarter should be interpreted with caution. We also exclude
data prior to 2022, even though interest in limitations of smaller-scale LMs had already
been rising since the introduction of models like BERT in 2018 [87, 125].
Future work could refine and extend these findings in several directions. First, the limitation
topics could be decomposed into subcategories, such as types of reasoning or specific forms of bias,
using hierarchical or agglomerative clustering techniques. Second, extending the analysis to earlier
years, especially the period following BERT’s introduction in 2018, could clarify how concerns
raised for smaller-scale PLMs have shifted, declined, or re-emerged with model scaling.

Rating Abstract Explanation
0 “ Multi-query attention (MQA), which only uses a single key-value
head, drastically speeds up decoder inference. However, MQA can lead
to quality degradation. [...] ” [4], EMNLP 2023No mention of LLMs
or their limitations.
1 “ We introduce the framework of ‘social learning’ in the context of
LLMs, whereby models share knowledge with each other in a
privacy-aware manner using natural language. [...] ” [74], arXiv, 2023Mentions LLMs but
does not discuss any
limitations.
2 “[...]LLMs... often display a considerable level of overconfidence
even when the question does not have a definitive answer. [...]
we propose a novel and scalable self-alignment method to utilize the
LLM itself to enhance its response-ability to different types of
unknown questions. [...] ” [18], EMNLP 2024Briefly identifies over-
confidence as a limita-
tion; used as motiva-
tion for the method.
3 “ [...]it remains difficult to distinguish effects of statistical
correlation from more systematic logical reasoning grounded
on the understanding of real world [in PLMs] . [...] We find that
models are consistently able to override real-world knowledge in
counterfactual scenarios... however, we also find that for most
models this effect appears largely to be driven by simple lexical
cues . [...]” [52], ACL 2023Discusses reasoning
limitations in moder-
ate detail, but not as
the main focus.
4 “ [...] we aim to assess the performance of OpenAI’s newest model,
GPT-4V(ision), specifically in the realm of multimodal medical
diagnosis. [...] While GPT-4V demonstrates proficiency in
distinguishing between medical image modalities and anatomy,
it faces significant challenges in disease diagnosis and
generating comprehensive reports. [...] while large multimodal
models have made significant advancements in computer vision and
NLP, it remains far from being used to effectively support
real-world medical applications and clinical decision-making.
[...]” [113], arXiv, 2023Focuses extensively
on GPT-4V’s limi-
tations in medical
applications, but also
explores strengths of
the model.
5 “ We analyze the capabilities of Transformer LMs on learning discrete
algorithms. [...] We observe that the compositional capabilities of
state-of-the-art Transformer language models are very limited
and sample-wise scale worse than relearning all sub-tasks for a
new algorithmic composition. We also present a theorem in
complexity theory, showing that gradient descent on
memorizing feedforward models can be exponentially data
inefficient. ” [101], arXiv, 2024Entirely focused on
identifying and an-
alyzing LLM limita-
tions in algorithmic
learning.LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 39
B Clustering Details
For HDBSCAN+BERTopic, we perform a grid search over UMAP, HDBSCAN and BERTopic to
produce meaningful clusters while minimizing the outliers. The final configurations are as follows:
•for ACL, UMAP is set to n_neighbors =25,n_components =10,min_dist =0.0; HDB-
SCAN to min_cluster_size =25,min_samples =10, and BERTopic to min_topic_size
=10.
•For ArXiv, UMAP is adjusted to n_neighbors =15,n_components =5,min_dist =0.05 ,
while HDBSCAN and BERTopic are set to min_cluster_size =40andmin_topic_size
=25.
Our initial runs revealed that many outliers were not true noise but rather positioned between
clusters, causing HDBSCAN (used within BERTopic) to misclassify them. To address this, we
implement a distance-based outlier reassignment strategy, where outliers identified by HDBSCAN
and BERTopic are reassigned to their most probable topic based on the topic probability distribution,
but only if they fall within a certain distance threshold to ensure proximity to an existing cluster.

Fig. 15. Histograms of distance metrics used for outlier detection in ACL dataset clustering. Each subplot
visualizes distances between a paper’s embedding (based on evidence and keyphrases) and either a cluster
centroid or nearest inlier, in both UMAP-reduced and original embedding spaces. These metrics help determine
the threshold for reassigning outliers to the closest cluster.
To determine this threshold, we test several distance metrics, namely 1) the Euclidean distance to
the closest cluster centroid in UMAP space, 2) the Euclidean distance to the closest inlier in UMAP
space, 3) the cosine distance to the closest cluster centroid in the original embedding space, and 4)
the cosine distance to the closest inlier in the original embedding space. As shown in Figure 15, the
UMAP Inlier Distance provides the clearest separation between inliers and outliers, such that we40 Last Name et al.
selected it for subsequent analysis. We set the outlier threshold at the dip between the two peaks,
using a value of 0.3.

C HDBSCAN + BERTopic Trend Analysis
In this section, we discuss LLLMs topic dynamics over time as identified by HDBSCAN + BERTopic.
We apply the following perspectives:
(i)LLM-wide share , measured annually as𝑁lim
𝑡,𝑦
𝑁LLM𝑦, to reflect how often limitation topic 𝑡appears
in LLM research in year 𝑦, relative to the total LLM papers. This shows whether a topic is
gaining attention beyond LLLMs research and becoming part of the general LLM research
agenda.
(ii)Limitations share , measured quarterly as𝑁lim
𝑡,𝑞
𝑁lim𝑞, to reflect the share of limitation-focused
papers in quarter 𝑞that address topic 𝑡. This shows the topic’s visibility within LLLMs
subfield.
Here,𝑁lim
𝑡,𝑦is the number of limitation papers on topic 𝑡in year𝑦;𝑁LLM
𝑦is the total number of LLM
papers in that year; and 𝑁lim
𝑡,𝑞,𝑁lim
𝑞are the number of limitation papers on topic 𝑡and the total
number of limitation papers, respectively, in quarter 𝑞.
(i) How are limitation topics represented in the broader growth of LLM research?
Key Insights
•Limitation topics show growing visibility within LLM research across both ACL and
arXiv datasets. Some concerns, such as Security andLong Context in ACL, surge specifi-
cally in 2024, while others like Reasoning andHallucination rise more steadily.
•On arXiv, the dramatic relative increases seen in 2023 (e.g., Hallucination ,Code Genera-
tion,Healthcare Application ) reflect the emergence of new concerns from a low baseline,
but many of these remain small in absolute share.
Figure 19 shows the annual distribution of LLM limitation topics as a proportion of all LLM-
focused papers in ACL and arXiv. Across both ACL and arXiv datasets, most limitation topics show
grow in visibility across LLM research from 2022 to 2024 in ACL and 2022 to early 2025 in arXiv.
However, as shown in Table 19 in the supplementary material, they do so at different pace. On
ACL, some concerns surged sharply in 2024, such as Security (+106%) and Long Context (+64%),
while others like Reasoning andHallucination grew more steadily across years. In contrast, topics
such as Generalization andSocial Bias showed growth in 2023 but flattened or declined by 2024.
On arXiv, most topics were marginal in 2022, leading to dramatic relative growth in 2023 as
new concerns entered the field: for example, Hallucination (+867%), Code Generation (+1200%), and
Healthcare Application (+1000%). Despite steep increases, many remained low in absolute share
(e.g., Code Generation at 0.13% in 2023). After this emergence, growth remained strong though less
extreme, especially for Reasoning ,Security Risks ,Multimodality , and Computational Cost . A few
topics declined by 2025, including Benchmark Contamination ,Quantization , and Knowledge Editing .
However, these topics are the least represented, and since 2025 data covers only one quarter, recent
drops should be interpreted with caution.
These comparisons reflect annual, macro-level trends in topical focus and relative prominence.
To examine shorter-term dynamics and account for changes in overall LLM publication volume,
measure the percentage of papers on each topic, relative to all LLM limitation papers, for each
quarter. Additionally, we apply the Mann-Kendall trend test [ 67] to identify whether each topic’s
share exhibits a consistent upward or downward trend across quarters. This non-parametric test is
well-suited for detecting monotonic trends in time series without assuming linearity or normality.48 Last Name et al.

Key Insights
•On ACL, Uncertainty is the only topic with a statistically significant upward trend, while
Social Bias andReasoning show non-significant declines after early peaks. Most other
topics remain relatively stable over time.
•On arXiv, Multimodality andHallucination show significant growth, with the former
likely linked to the rise of vision-language models. Knowledge Editing also increases,
though not significantly.
Among ACL limitation topics (Figure 20a), we observe the following temporal patterns:
•↑Increasing: Uncertainty shows the clearest upward trend, rising from around 5–6% in
mid-2022 to over 10% by late 2024. This trend is statistically significant according to the
Mann-Kendall test ( 𝜏= 0.64,𝑝= 0.0123). Hallucination also trends upward but does not
reach statistical significance ( 𝜏= 0.42,𝑝= 0.107).
•↓Decreasing: In contrast, Social Bias peaks sharply in 2022-Q3 (26%), then declines and
stabilizes below 15% in subsequent quarters. Due to the inconsistency of this change, it is notLLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 49

significant in the Mann-Kendal test ( 𝑝= 0.283). Reasoning remains the most prevalent topic,
consistently ranging between 30–40% per quarter. While the test indicates a downward
tendency (𝜏= –0.38), the trend is not statistically significant ( 𝑝= 0.152).50 Last Name et al.
Other topics remain relatively stable over time:
•→ Plateau / Stable: Hallucination ,Security , and Generalization each remain within a 5–15%
range with no significant directional movement. Long Context also shows minor variation
but no sustained change. These patterns are consistent with the Mann-Kendall test, which
detects no significant trends for any of these topics.
Some topics also show sharp, isolated changes. Social Bias spikes in 2022-Q3 (26%), then drops to
around 10% by early 2023. This may reflect heightened concern about bias in the early stages of
LLM deployment, which is also visible in the annual distribution (Figure 19), where Social Bias is
the second most prominent topic in 2022 but (relative to the overall expansion of LLLMs research)
declines in later years. Reasoning peaks in 2022-Q4 and again in 2023-Q3 ( 35–40%), likely reflecting
increased interest following the launch of ChatGPT and GPT-4 [ 1] in late 2022 and early 2023.
Security sees a modest increase in 2024-Q2 and Q3, which might be related to growing concerns
about jailbreaks and adversarial attacks.
Among arXiv limitation topics (Figure 20b), we observe the following temporal patterns:
•↑Increasing: Multimodality shows the most consistent upward trend, increasing from
around 5% in early 2022 to 15% by early 2025. This pattern is statistically significant according
to the Mann-Kendall trend test ( 𝜏= 0.59,𝑝= 0.006), and likely reflects heightened interest
following the release of GPT-4V [ 1], LLaVA [ 61], and other vision-language models in
mid-2023.
Hallucination also grows slightly over time, from 10% to 13%, and this increase is statistically
significant as well ( 𝜏= 0.51,𝑝= 0.017). Knowledge Editing also exhibits an upward trajectory,
though this trend does not reach statistical significance ( 𝜏= 0.41,𝑝= 0.051).
•↓Decreasing: Context & Memory Limitations exhibits a clear and statistically significant
decline, dropping from 25% in 2022-Q1 to around 12–13% by 2025 ( 𝜏= –0.46,𝑝= 0.033). This
shift may reflect improved handling of long inputs through retrieval-augmented methods
and the emergence of models with extended context capabilities [56].
Conversational Limitations follows a similar downward trajectory ( 𝜏= –0.44,𝑝= 0.044),
though its decline appears to plateau at the beginning of 2024.
•→ Stable / Plateau: Other topics remain relatively stable: Security Risks appears to grow
from 12% to 18%, and Social Bias gradually declines from 23% to 17%, but neither trend is
statistically significant ( 𝑝= 0.127 and𝑝= 0.502, respectively). This may be because concerns
regarding social bias increased immediately following the release of ChatGPT but then
returned to the pre-ChatGPT level. Reasoning ,Multilinguality ,Code Generation , and Health-
care Application all fluctuate without a clear directional trend, while Computational Cost ,
Benchmark Contamination ,Knowledge Editing , and Quantization remain low throughout.LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 51

D LlooM Topic Co-Occurrence
LLLMs are often studied in combination, as reflected in the high number of multi-topic papers: 43%
in ACL and over 60% in arXiv, with some spanning up to eight topics (see Table 20). These overlaps
often reflect shared task setups (e.g., multimodal hallucination) or related concerns (e.g., alignment
and bias). We analyze these links via topic co-occurrence.

4ARXIV Topic Co-occurrence (LlooM) (ii)arXiv Topic Co-occurrence Matrix
Fig. 21. Topic co-occurrence matrices for ACL and arXiv LLM limitation papers, clustered by LlooM approach.
In both ACL and arXiv papers, topic co-occurrences tend to concentrate around the largest
clusters (see Figure 21). The main patterns are as follows:
•Reasoning shows the highest co-occurrence with other limitations, especially in ACL. It
frequently overlaps with Knowledge Editing (171 ACL), Hallucination (153 ACL; 314 arXiv),
Multimodality (80 ACL; 414 arXiv), and Generalization (65 ACL; 1186 arXiv), as well as Long
Context andAlignment Limitations . These links reflect how flawed reasoning can lead to
other issues, such as brittle updates in knowledge editing [ 126], incoherent multimodal
responses [63], and hallucinations [72].LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models 53
•Trustworthiness covers not only failures across Alignment Limitations (1310), Security Risks
(1117), Privacy Risks (276), but also general output reliability, co-occurring with Reasoning
(1650), and Hallucination (117). Trust breaks down in different ways: flawed reasoning yields
faulty responses [ 34], misalignment leads to persuasive but incorrect outputs [ 112], and
adversarial prompts can trigger data leaks [88].
•Generalization co-occurs with Reasoning ,Multimodality ,Knowledge Editing ,Prompt Sensi-
tivity ,Security Risks , and Bias and Fairness , reflecting how it is stress-tested across prompts,
tasks, and domains. For instance, models often fail under prompt perturbations [ 7], OOD
reasoning [97], or clinical QA [78].
•Alignment Limitations and Security Risks cluster with issues focused on output control: Bias
and Fairness (631), Prompt Sensitivity (170), Privacy Risks (149), and Hallucination (325 with
alignment; 154 with security). These links reflect how attempts to control model behavior can
introduce new failures: e.g. fine-tuning for alignment can increase hallucination rates [ 60].
In high-stakes domains like medicine, these concerns combine: hallucination, misalignment,
and privacy risks all compromise safe deployment of LLMs in clinical settings [107].
•Hallucination appears with a wide range of issues: Knowledge Editing ,Language and Cultural
Limitations , and Long Context in ACL; Bias and Fairness (333), Multimodality (129), and
Generalization in arXiv, highlighting its role across both technical and sociocultural settings.
•Bias and Fairness with sociocultural and safety concerns: Language and Cultural Limitations
(100 ACL; 193 arXiv), Prompt Sensitivity (165), Security Risks (108), and Multimodality (67),
forming a distinct subcluster focused on language representation and cultural alignment
[23, 110].
These co-occurrence patterns show that many failures are often studied in combination. As
a result, even if individual topics are not always the primary focus, they continue to appear in
multi-topic work. This overlap likely contributes to the trend stability observed earlier: few topics
disappear entirely because they remain relevant through their connections to others.
