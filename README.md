## Research Motivation

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is increasingly used in
NLP research to address hallucination and improve factual
grounding in language models. This project was built to
experiment with and understand RAG pipelines in an academic
research setting.
## 🎓 Research Assistant Focus

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement
a research-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system,
a technique widely used in modern NLP and AI research.

Key research skills demonstrated:
- Semantic retrieval using FAISS
- Embedding-based document indexing
- Context-grounded LLM generation
- Modular and reproducible research code
